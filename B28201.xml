            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Most Reverend Father in GOD, JOHN, By Divine Providence Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> Primate of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT I presume to prefix so great a Name to these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is not that I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they bear any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Honour,</hi> but only <hi>need</hi> the <hi>support</hi> of your Patronage; a Credit less than your <hi>Grace</hi>'s would not be sufficient to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb facs="tcp:46331:4"/> and authorize <hi>Morality</hi> in a loose and dissolute World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I confess my self <hi>Principal</hi> in this Presumption up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Goodness, but must, out of a little kind of Revenge, bring in the Learned and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Undertakers, as <hi>Accessaries</hi> for their ready and unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in the choice of your <hi>Grace</hi> for their Patron: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who better qualified for the Protection of an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Moralist, than so great a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? tho none more unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to it than my self. Your Lordship's Character is too high, and you <hi>taste</hi> too fine and distinguishing to relish an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress from so mean a Pen; and I find the confidence of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt obliges me to account for the Motives that induc'd me to it. The Relation I have to that
<pb facs="tcp:46331:4"/> famous <hi>Cathedral,</hi> which your <hi>Grace</hi> is pleas'd so frequently to fill with your excellent Presence, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with your admirable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; as also that I had to your venerable <hi>Predecessor;</hi> and to that Learned and Worthy <hi>Society</hi> which enjoys the peculiar Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of having my <hi>Lord Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>York</hi> its <hi>Visiter,</hi> first encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, and will, I hope, in some measure, qualifie my boldness in the Dedication: Besides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscious no production of my own could ever deserve to appear under your <hi>Grace</hi>'s Name, I thought it more eligible to run the risk of Censure, than be found wanting even to a <hi>borrow'd</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of expressing that great Zeal and Veneration I have for your Lordship's Merits, by Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as well as Duty. And yet, for my own part, my Lord, I
<pb facs="tcp:46331:5"/> who conceive my self, upon the above-mention'd Reasons, bound to devote my best, though the meanest endeavours imaginable, to your <hi>Grace</hi>'s Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, should scarce have offered a Person in your Lordship's Station the easie products of a few va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant hours; did not the number and worth of the Gentlemen concern'd, enhance the value of the Present; had not the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Affinity with my Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and were there not Precedent both Ancient and Modern on my side. The Learn'd <hi>Erasmus</hi> has dedicated his Version of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Chapter of our <hi>Author</hi>'s Morals to one of your <hi>Grace</hi>'s Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; and another, the first in this Volume, to the great <hi>Monarch,</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight. And would not this bring me off, yet I perswade my self the <hi>Candour</hi> of your <hi>Grace</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:46331:5"/>
               <hi>Temper,</hi> would prove a sure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge at last, and easily pardon what the <hi>severity</hi> of your <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> could not approve. The Truth is, my Lord, I was indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some publick Testimony of my Gratitude to your <hi>Grace</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Predecessor;</hi> but had not wherewith to discharge the Debt: This Sum was lent me, but too late; and then who had a better Title to it, and to whom could I with more honesty pay it, than to him who succeeds him in his great Abilities, as well as in his See? And he (for I must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be just to a Memory so precious) came every way up to the Dignity of his Character; had a rare happiness in seconding the Determinations of a clear and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Judgment, with an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Resolution in the pursuit of them. He was most religiously
<pb facs="tcp:46331:6"/> Pious towards his God, without leaning towards either the Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Superstition,</hi> or the Rants of <hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> zealous for the Church without Bigottry in his Head, or Interest in his Heart; obstinately Loyal to his Sovereign, out of Conscience, Learned, without Pomp and Noise; of an easy, yet awful kindness to his Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and of a wonderful affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to all Men: In short, one to be equall'd by few, out-done perhaps by none, but his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</p>
            <p>As to the Author himself, my Lord, your <hi>Grace</hi> has not only shown your self an accurate Judge of his great Worth in his own Native Language, by the great esteem you have always had for him, but has farther set an additional value upon him, in making many of the noble
<pb facs="tcp:46331:6"/> Precepts he delivers, speak <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> long ago through the whole course of your Life, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to any farther Version of him, I think I need only say, 'tis pity such equally bright and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Notions should be confin'd to a very few Readers of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and perhaps fewer Judges of his Sense: Lie buried either under the rubbish of his own <hi>Greek,</hi> or the unfashionable and unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible <hi>English</hi> of an antiquated Translator. If it need any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vindication, I am sensible 'tis either to those, who would ingross all good sense to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or who are too lazy or too weak for the performance, whom I am not bound to satisfie. If any thing prove but happy enough to recommend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to your <hi>Grace,</hi> 'twill be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to gain it the approbation
<pb facs="tcp:46331:7"/> of all understanding Men; and for others, their dislike will be really a Kindness. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's good Opinion will make a Translation <hi>authentick:</hi> But, my Lord, it is not only the knowing, but the good Man, the tried <hi>Royalist,</hi> and the excellent <hi>Bishop,</hi> that render you admirable. Your vast and active Genius qualifi'd you for Government, and your Learning and Piety, striking upon the discerning Goodness of your <hi>Royal Patron,</hi> determin'd it to the Church: A Prince, who as in all things else, so in this particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, makes good his Claim to that Illustrious Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith;</hi> that he fills up the most eminent Stations in the Church with such vigorous and able As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of it as your <hi>Grace.</hi> And indeed, who better deserv'd to be intrusted with the Spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:46331:7"/> Sword now, than he who once so bravely wielded the Temporal in its Defence? And yet, my Lord, the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> seems to be the least part of your Character. Now that you are arriv'd at al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the highest Pinacle of the Temple; you grow greater in the good Opinion of all Men, by a generous Contempt of the Vanities of Greatness under your view, and rise by your Condescensions. For you have not unlearn'd the Offices of an Inferiour Order, from your advancement to a Superiour. The great and ancient City of <hi>York</hi> is not more the Center of your Government, than your <hi>Cure</hi> the subject of your Pastoral and Ministerial Care. And to fill up all the momentous Duties of your Sacred Function, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you truly <hi>Primitive,</hi> You
<pb facs="tcp:46331:8"/> second the unparallel'd Eloquence of your <hi>Tongue</hi> with that of your <hi>Life:</hi> whilst the one <hi>teaches</hi> your Auditors their <hi>Duty,</hi> the other <hi>encourages</hi> their <hi>Practise;</hi> by that you most clearly <hi>instruct,</hi> by this you most effectually <hi>apply;</hi> and this, and yet much more than this, is but the first Fruits the earnest of a few Months Enjoyment of your Dignity. Your Lordship must (may I with all humility use the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Expression) give me leave to promise the World mighty things from a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of such great and noble Qualifications. My Lord, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to Panegyrick in what I say; am not fond of lighting a Taper to the Sun. All persons, who have any merit of their own, must acknowledge your <hi>Graces:</hi> Your Actions are your true
<pb facs="tcp:46331:8"/> Elogies; and he must have your own <hi>Tongue</hi> or <hi>Pen,</hi> and have the Honour <hi>personally</hi> to know you, who would rightly praise you. I cannot flatter, and besides your <hi>Grace</hi> is above it. <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Essay upon the Subject is enough to make a Man abominate that sordid and unmanly Artifice, And your Lordship's Sagacity would easily discover me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of his Directions. But, my Lord, your minutes are too precious that I should any farther rob your <hi>Grace,</hi> or your <hi>Province,</hi> of them; and my deep Sense, and just value of your <hi>Grace</hi>'s merits naturally conclude in wishes for a long and happy continuance of their Influence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. That therefore your <hi>Grace</hi> may live an aged Patron and Promoter of Learning and Industry; Example of Piety and
<pb facs="tcp:46331:9"/> Religion, Support and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the best of Churches, and the Spirit and Genius of your own Province in particular, is the passionate and dis-interess'd wish of,</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46331:10"/> himself; and through abundance of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance to his own Person, not only wishes, but thinks himself Master of all those Perfections which may recommend him to others. And tho indeed it be laudable enough to covet such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, yet is it altogether unsafe for any Man to fancy them inherent in him.</p>
               <p>Now if Truth be a Ray of the Divinity, as <hi>Plato</hi> says it is, and the Source of all the Good that derives upon either Gods or Men, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Flatterer must be look'd upon as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy to all the Gods, and especially to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo;</hi> for he always acts counter to that celebrated Oracle of his <hi>[Know your self;]</hi> endeavouring to make every Man his own Cheat, by keeping him ignorant of the good and ill Qualities that are in him; whereupon the Good never arrive at perfection, and the Ill grow incorrigible.</p>
               <p>Did Flattery indeed, as most other Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes do, generally or altogether wait on the debauch'd and ignoble part of Mankind, the Mischief were of less Consequence, and might admit of an easier Prevention: But, as Worms breed most in sweet and tender Woods; so usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the most obliging, the most brave and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tempers readiliest receive, and longest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the flattering Insect, that hangs and grows upon them. And since, to use <hi>Simonides</hi>'s Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it is not for Persons of a narrow Fortune, but for Gentlemen of Estates, to keep a good Stable of Horses; so never saw we Flattery the Attendant of the Poor, the inglorious and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Plebeian,</hi> but of the Grandees of the World, the Distemper and Bane of great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Affairs, the Plague in Kings Chambers, and the Ruine of their Kingdoms: Therefore it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46331:10"/> is a Business of no small importance, and which requires no ordinary Circumspection, so to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know a Flatterer in every Shape he assumes, that the Counterfeit Res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mblance sometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring not <hi>true Friendship</hi> it self into Suspicion and Dis-repute. For Parasites, like Lice, which desert a dying Man, whose pall'd and vapid Blood can feed them no longer, never intermix in dry and insipid Business, where there's nothing to be got; but prey upon a nobler Quarry, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, and Potentates of the Earth, and afterwards lowsily shirk off, if the Greatness of their Fortune chance to leave them. But it will not be Wisdom in us to stay till such fatal Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and then try the Experiment, which will not only be useless, but dangerous and hurtful; for 'tis a deplorable thing for a Man to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self then destitute of Friends, when he most wants them, and has not an Opportunity neither of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing his false, his faithless, for a fast and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Friend. And therefore we should rather try our Friend, as we do our Money, whether or no he be passable and current, before we need him. For 'tis not enough to discover the Cheat to our Cost, but we must so understand the Flatterer, that he put no Cheat upon us; otherwise we should act like those who must needs take Poyson to know its Strength, and foolishly hazard their Life to inform their Judgment. And as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve of this careless, so neither of that too scrupulous Humour of those, who taking the Measures of true Friendship only from the bare Honesty and usefulness of the Man, immediately suspect a pleasant and easie Conversation for a Cheat. For a Friend is not a dull, tasteless thing, nor does the <hi>Decorum</hi> of Frienship consist in sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46331:11"/> and austerity of Temper, but its very Port and Gravity is soft and amiable:
<q>Where Love and all the Graces do reside.</q> For 'tis not only a Comfort to the Afflicted,
<q>T' enjoy the Courtesie of his kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st Friend,</q> As <hi>Euripides</hi> speaks; but Friendship extends it self to both Fortunes, as well brightens and adorns Prosperity, as allays the Sorrows that attend Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. And as <hi>Euenus</hi> used to say, <hi>That Fire makes the best Sauce;</hi> so Friendship, wherewith God has seasoned the Circumstances of our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, gives a Relish to every Condition, renders them all easie, sweet, and agreeable enough. And indeed, did not the Laws of Friendship ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a little Pleasantry and good Humor, why should the Parasite insinuate himself under that Disguise? And yet he, as counterfeit Gold, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Brightness and Lustre of the true, always puts on the Easiness and Freedom of a Friend, is always pleasant and obliging, and ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Humor of his Company. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis no way reasonable neither, to look upon every just Character that is given us as a piece of Flattery; for certainly a due and seasonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is as much the Duty of one Friend to another, as a pertinent and serious Reprehension; nay, indeed a sowr querulous Temper is perfectly repugnant to the Laws of Friendship and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: whereas a Man takes a Chiding patiently from a Friend, who is as ready to praise his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as to animadvert upon his Vices willingly perswading himself that meer Necessity obliged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46331:11"/> him to reprimand, whom Kindness had first mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to commend him. Why then, may some say, 'tis infinitely difficult at this Rate, to distinguish a Flatterer from a Friend, since there's no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Difference, either betwixt the Satisfaction they create, or the Praises they bestow. Nay, 'tis observable, that a Parasite is frequently more obsequious and obliging than a Friend himself.</p>
               <p>Well, the way then to discover the Disparity? Why, I'll tell you: If you would learn the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true subtil Flatterer, who nicks his Point <hi>Secundum Artem;</hi> you must not with the Vulgar, mistake those sordid Smell-Feasts, and poor Trencher-slaves, for your Men, <hi>who begin to prate as soon as they have wash'd their Hands in order to Dinner,</hi> as one says of them; and e're they are well warmed with a good Cut of the first Dish, and a Glass of Wine, betray the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Soul that acts them, by the nauseous and fulsome Buffoonry they vent at Table. For sure there needed no great Sagacity to detect the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Melanthius, Alexander Pheraecus</hi>'s Parasite, who being asked how his Master was murdered? made answer, That he was run through his Body into the Side. Nor must we, again, confine our Notions of Flatterers, to those sharping Fellows, who ply about Rich Mens Tables, whom neither Fire, nor Sword, nor Porter, can keep from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; nor yet to such as were those Female Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who going into <hi>Syria,</hi> were Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Steps,</hi> because they cringed so to the great Ladies of that Country, that they mounted their Chariots on their Backs.</p>
               <p>Well, but after all, Who is this Flatterer then, whom we ought so industriously to avoid?</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46331:12"/>
               <p>I answer: He who neither professes, nor seems to flatter; who never haunts your Kitching, is never observed to watch the Dial, that he may nick your Supper-time; who won't drink to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, but will keep his Brains about him; who is prying and inquisitive, would mix in your Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and wind himself into your Secrets. In short, he who acts the Friend, not with the Air of a Comaedian or a Satyrist, but with the Port and Gravity of a Tragedian: For, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, <hi>'Tis the height of Injustice to appear. Just, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Knave.</hi> So are we to look upon those Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers as most dangerous, who walk not bare-fac'd, but in disguise; who make no sport, but mind their Business; for these often personate the true and sincere Friend so exactly, that 'tis enough to make him fall under the like Suspicion of a Cheat, unless we be extreamly curious in remarking the Difference betwixt them. It's storied of <hi>Gobias,</hi> (one of the <hi>Persian</hi> Nobility, who joyn'd with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> against the <hi>Magi</hi>) that being in pursuit of one of them, he accidentally stept into a little obscure House, where he absconded, and there fell upon him; during the Scuffle, <hi>Darius</hi> came in, and drew upon the Enemy, but durst not push at him, lest perhaps he might wound his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Gobrias</hi> with the Thrust; whereupon <hi>Gobrias</hi> bad him, rather than fail, run both through to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But since we can by no means admit of that vulgar Saying, <hi>Let my Friend perish, so my Enemy perish with him;</hi> but had rather still endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the Discovery of a Parasite from a Friend, notwithstanding the nearness of the Resemblance, we ought to use our utmost Care, lest at any time we indifferently reject the Good with the Bad, or unadvisedly retain the Bad with the Good, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46331:12"/> Friend and Flatterer together. For as those wild Grains which usually grow up with Wheat, and are of the same Figure and Bigness with it, are not easily winnowed from it; for they either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pass through the holes of the Sieve, if narrow, or pass together with the Wheat, if larger: So is it infinitely difficult to distinguish Flattery from Friendship, because the one so exquisitely mixes with all the Passions, Humors, Interest, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the others.</p>
               <p>Now because the Enjoyment of a Friend is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the greatest Satisfaction incident to Humanity,<note place="margin">Wherein a Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiteth a Friend. 1. In an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. In the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note> and therefore the Flatterer always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to render his Conversation highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and agreeable.</p>
               <p>Again, Because all Acts of Kindness and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Beneficence are the constant Attendants upon true Friendship (on which account we usually say, <hi>A Friend is more necessary than Fire or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) therefore the Flatterer is ready upon every occasion to obtrude his Service upon you, and will with an indefatigable Bustle and Zeal, seek to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you, if he can.</p>
               <p>In the next Place,<note place="margin">3. In the likeness of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Origin of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> the Parasite observing that all true Friendship takes its Origin from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of like Humors and Inclinations, and that the same Passions, the same Aversations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are the first Cement of a true and lasting Friendship; he turns immediately all <hi>first</hi> Matter, capable of every <hi>Form,</hi> like soft Wax, pliant and yielding to any Impression, that the Person on whom he designs shall think fit to stamp upon him; and, in fine, so neatly resembles the Original, that one would swear,
<q>Sure thou the very <hi>Achilles</hi> art, and not his Son.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46331:13"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friend.</note>But the most exquisite Fineness of a Flatterer, consists in his Imitation of that Freedom of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which Friends particularly use in mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehending each other.</p>
               <p>For finding that Men usually take it for what it really is, the natural Language of Friendship, as peculiar to it as certain Notes or Voices are to certain Animals; and that, on the contrary, a shie and sheepish Reserv'dness looks both rude and unfriendly, he lets not even this proper Character of a Friend escape his Imitation. But as skilful Cooks use to correct lushious Meats with sharp and pionant Sawce, that they may not be so apt to overcharge the Stomach; so he seasons his Flattery now and then with a little Smartness and Severity, lest the Fulsomness of repeated Dissimulation should pall and cloy the Company. And yet his Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions always carry something in them, that looks not true and genuine; he seems to do't but with a kind of a sneering and grinning Countenance at the best; and though his Reproofs may possibly tickle the Ear, yet they never strike effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart. On these accounts then 'tis as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to discern a Flatterer from a Friend, as to know those Animals again, which always wear the Livery of the last Thing they touch upon. And therefore since he puts so easily upon us, under the Disguise and Appearance of a Friend, it will be our Business at present to unmask the Hypocrite, and shew him in other Mens Shapes and Colours; as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks, since he has none properly his own.</p>
               <p>Well then, let us enquire regularly into this Affair.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46331:13"/>
               <p>We have already asserted,<note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flatterers counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the Humors and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Person whom he flatters.</note> That Friendship generally takes its rise from a Conformity of Tempers and Dispositions, whereby different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons come to have the same Taste of the like Humors, Customs, Studies, Exercises and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, as these following Verses import:
<q>
                     <l>Old Men with Old, and Boys with Boys agree;</l>
                     <l>And Womens Clack with Womens Company.</l>
                     <l>Men that are crazy, full of Sores and Pain,</l>
                     <l>Love to diseased Persons to complain.</l>
                     <l>And they who labour under adverse Fate,</l>
                     <l>Tell their sad Stories to th' Ʋnfortunate.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Flatterer then observing how congenial it is to our Natures, to delight in the Conversation of those who are, as it were, the Counter-part of our selves, makes his first approaches to our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at this Avenue, where he gradually advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (like one making towards a wild Beast in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, with a Design to tame and bring it to hand) by accommodating himself to the same Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Business, and <hi>Colour</hi> of Life with the Person upon whom he designs, till at last he gives him an Opportunity to catch him, and becomes tractable by the Man who strokes him. All this while the Flatterer falls foul upon those Courses of Life, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Things he perceives his Cully to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and then again as extravagantly commends those he is pleased to honour with his Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; still perswading the Fop, that his Choice and Dislike are not the Results of Passion, but of a solid and discerning Judgment.</p>
               <p>Well then,<note place="margin">How to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him therein.</note> by what Signs or Tokens shall we be able to know this Counterfeit Copy of our selves, from that which is true and genuine?</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46331:14"/>
               <p>In the first place, we must accurately remark upon the whole Tenor of his Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether or no the Resemblance he pretends to the Original be of any continuance, natural and easie, and all of a piece, whether he square his Actions according to any one steady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Model, as becomes an ingenuous Lover of Conversation and Friendship, which is all of one Thread, and still like it self; for this is a true Friend indeed. But the Flatterer, who has no Principles in him, and leads not a Life properly his own, but forms and moulds it according to the various Humors and Caprices of those he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to bubble, is never one and the same Man, but a meer <hi>Dapple</hi> or <hi>Trimmer,</hi> who changes Shapes with his Company, like Water that always turns and winds it self into the Figure of the Channel through which it flows. Apes, it seems, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally caught by their antick Mimickry of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Gesticulations of Men; and yet the Men themselves are trapann'd by the same Craft of Imitation in a Flatterer, who adapts himself to their several Humors, Fencing and Wrestling with one, Singing and Dancing with another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he's in Chafe of a Spark that delights in a Pack of Dogs, he follows him at the Heels, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing almost as loud as <hi>Hippolitus</hi> in the Tragedy <hi>Phaedra;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>O what a Pleasure 'tis, ye Gods to wind</l>
                     <l>The shrill-mouth'd Horn, and chase the dapled Hind!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet the Hunter himself is the Game he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs for the Toils. If he be in pursuit of some Bookish young Gentleman, then he's always a poring, nourishes his reverend Beard down to his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46331:14"/> Heels, wears a tatter'd Cloak, affects the careless Indifferency of a Philosopher, and can now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of nothing under <hi>Plato</hi>'s Triangles and Rectangles. If he chance to fall into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of a drunken, idle Debauchee, who has got an Estate,
<q>Then sly <hi>Ulysses</hi> throws away his Rags,</q> Puts off his long Robe, mows down his fruitless Crop of Beard, drinks briskly, laughs modishly on the Walks, and drolls handsomly upon the Philosophical Fops of the Town. And thus, they say it happen'd at <hi>Syracuse;</hi> for when <hi>Plato</hi> first arrived there, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> was wonderfully hot upon the Study of Philosophy, all the Area's in the Kings Palace were full of nothing but Dust and Sand, by reason of the great Concourse of Geometricians, who came to draw their Figures, and demonstrate there: But no sooner was <hi>Plato</hi> in Disgrace at Court, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> finally fallen from Philosophy to Wine and Women, Trifles and Intemperance, then Learning fell into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Disrepute, and the whole Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as if bewitched by some <hi>Circe</hi> or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came universally stupid, idle, and infatuated. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, I appeal to the Practices of Men noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for Flattery and Popularity, to back my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; witness he who topp'd them all, <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> who, when he dwelt at <hi>Athens,</hi> was as arch and witty as any <hi>Athenian</hi> of them all, kept his Stable of Horses, play'd the good Fellow, and was universally obliging; and yet the same Man at <hi>Sparta</hi> shaved close to the Skin, wore his Cloak, never bath'd but in cold Water. When he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in <hi>Thrace,</hi> he drunk and fought like a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46331:15"/>
                  <hi>Thracian;</hi> and again, in <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> his Company in <hi>Asia,</hi> he acted the part of a soft arrogant, and voluptuous Asiatick. And thus by an easie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Humors and Customs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongst whom he conversed, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of their Affections and Interests. So did not the brave <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> nor <hi>Agisilaus,</hi> who though they had to do with great Variety of Men, and Manners, and Cities of vastly different Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet were they still the same Men, and every where, through the whole Circle of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, maintain'd a Port and Character worthy of themselves. And so was <hi>Plato</hi> the same Man at <hi>Syracuse</hi> that he was in the Academy; the same in <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Court that he was in <hi>Dion</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>But he who will take the pains to act the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler himself, by interchangably decrying and extolling the same Things, Discourses, Ways of Living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will easily perceive that the Opinions of a Flatterer are as mutable and inconstant as the Colours of a <hi>Pourcuttle,</hi> that he is never consonant to himself, nor properly his own Man; that all his Passions, his Love and Hatred, his Joy and Sorrow, are borrowed and counterfeit; and that, in a Word, like a Looking-Glass, he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and represents the several Faces or Images of other Mens Affections and Humors. Do but discommend one of your Acquaintance a little in his Company, and hee'l tell you 'tis a wonder you never found him out all this while, for his part, he never fancied him in his Life. Change but your Stile, and commend him, he presently swears you oblige him in it, gives you a thousand thanks for the Gentleman's Sake, and believes your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him to be but just. Tell him you have thoughts of altering your Course of Life; as for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46331:15"/> Instance, to retire from all publick Imploys to Privacy and Ease; he immediately wishes that he had retreated long ago from the Hurry and Drudgery of Business, and the <hi>Odium</hi> that attends it. Seem but again inclinable to an Active Life: Why now, says he, you speak like your self: Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Ease are sweet; 'tis true, but withal, mean and inglorious. When you have thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd him, 'twould be proper to cashier him with some such reply as this:
<q>How now my Friend, what, quite another Man?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I abhor a Fellow who servilely complies with whatever I propose, and keeps pace with me in all my Motions (my Shadow can do that better than your self) but my Friend must deal plainly and impartially, and assist me faithfully with his Judgment.</p>
               <p>And thus you see one way of discerning a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer from a Friend.</p>
               <p>Another Difference observable betwixt them in the Resemblance they bear to each other is, that a true Friend will not rashly commend nor imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate every thing, but only what really deserves it; for he, as <hi>Sophocles</hi> says,
<q>Hates in his Friend the Vice, but loves the Man.</q> and will scorn to bear a part with him in any base and dishonorable Actions, unless, as People sometimes catch Blear-eyes; he may chance insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to contract some ill Habit or other by the very Contagion of Familiarity and Conversation. Thus they say <hi>Plato</hi>'s Acquaintance learned the Shrug of his Shoulders, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s his Stammering,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46331:16"/> and <hi>Alexander</hi>'s the Inclination of his Neck, and the Roughness of his Voice: For some Persons, e're they are aware, get a Touch of the Humors and Infirmities of those with whom they converse. But now as a true Friend endeavours only to Copy the fairest Originals; so, on the contrary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Flatterer, like the <hi>Camelion,</hi> which puts on all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours but the <hi>Innocent</hi> White, being unable to reach those Strokes of Vertue which are worth his Imitation, takes care however that no Failure or Imperfection escape him. As unskilful Painters, when they can't hit the Features and Air of a Face, content themselves with the faint Resemblance in a Wrinkle, a Wart, or a Scar; so he takes up with his Friends Intemperance, Superstition, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerickness, Severity to his Servants, Distrust of his Relations and Domesticks, or the like. For, besides that a natural Propensity to Evil, inclines him always to follow the worst Examples, he i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines his assuming other Mens Vices will best secure him from the Suspition of being disaffected towards them, for their Fidelity is often suspected who seem satisfied with Faults, and with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; which very thing lost <hi>Dion</hi> in the good Opinion of <hi>Dionysius, Samius</hi> in <hi>Philip</hi>'s, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> in <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s, and at last proved the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Ruine: And therefore the Flatterer pretends not only to the good Humor of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, but to the Faithfulness of a Friend too, and would be thought to have so great a Respect for you, that he cannot be disgusted at the very worst of your Actions, as being indeed of the same Make and Constitution with your self. Hence you shall have him pretend a Share in the most common Casualties that befal another; nay, in Complaisance, feign even Diseases themselves: in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46331:16"/> Company of those who are thick of Hearing, he's presently half Deaf; and with the dim Sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can see no more then they do. So the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites about <hi>Dionysius</hi> at an Entertainment, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor his Blindness, stumbled one upon another, and justled the Dishes off his Table.</p>
               <p>But there are others who refine upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by a pretended Fellow-suffering in the more private Concernments of Life, whereby they rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle themselves deeper into the Affections of those they flatter; as, if they find a Man unhappily married, or distrustful of his Children or Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, they spare not their own Family, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entertain you with some lamentable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the hard Fortune they have met with in their Children, their Wife, their Servants, or Relations: For by the Parallel Circumstances they pretend to, they seem more passionately concern'd for the Misfortunes of their Friends; who, as if they had already received some Pawn and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Fidelity, blab forth those Secrets which they cannot afterwards handsomly retract, and dare not betray the least Distrust of their new Confident for the future. I my self knew a Man, who turn'd his Wife out of Doors, because a Gentleman of his Acquaintance divorc'd his, though the Lady, who was thus discarded, smelt the Intrigue afterwards by the Messages the other's Husband sent, and the private Visits he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to make her: So little did he understand the Flatterer, who took these following Verses for the Description of a Crab rather than his;
<q>
                     <l>The shapeless Thing's all over Paunch and Gut:</l>
                     <l>Who can the Monsters mighty Hunger glut?</l>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:46331:17"/>
                     <l>It crawls on Teeth, and with a watchful Eye,</l>
                     <l>Does into every secret Corner pry.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For this is the true Portraiture of those Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who, as <hi>Eupolis</hi> speaks, spunge upon their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance for a Dinner. But we will reserve these Remarks for a more proper Place.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I must not omit the other Artifice observable in his Imitation; which is this:</p>
               <p>That if at any time he counterfeit the good Qualities of his Friend, he immediately yields him the Preheminence: whereas there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, no Emulation or Envy amongst true Friends, but whether they are equally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd or no, they bear the same even uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Temper of Mind towards each other. But the Flatterer, remembring that he is but to act anothers Part, pretends only to such Strokes as fall short of the Original, and is willing to confess himself out-done in any thing but his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein alone he claims the Precedency to himself; as if the Man he is to wheedle be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and morose, he's quite over run with Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; if something Superstitious, he's a perfect <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast;</hi> if a little in Love, for his part, he's most desperately smitten: I laugh'd heartily at such a Passage, says one: But I had like to have died with Laughter, says the other. But now in speaking of any laudable Qualities, he inverts his Stile, as, I can run fast enough, says he; but you perfectly fly. I can sit an Horse tolerably well; but alas! What's that to this <hi>Hippocentaure</hi> for good Horsemanship? I have a tolerable good <hi>Genius</hi> for Poetry, and am none of the worst Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifiers of the Age;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46331:17"/>
                  <q>But Thunder is the Languague of you Gods, not mine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus at the same time he obliges his Friend both in approving of his Abilities, by his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and in confessing him incomparable in his way by his coming short of his Example. These then are the distinguishing Characters of a a <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Flatterer,</hi> as far as concerns the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Resemblance betwixt them.</p>
               <p>But because, as we have before observ'd,<note place="margin">How to discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them in the Pleasure they create.</note> 'tis common to them both to please (for a good Man is no less taken with the Company of his Friends, than an ill one is with a Flatterer's) let us discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them here too. And the way will be to have an Eye to the end to which they direct, the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they create, which may be thus illustrated. Your perfumed Oyls have a fine odoriferous Scent, and so, it may be, have some Medicines too: but with this difference, that the former are prepared barely for the gratification of the Sense, whilst the other, besides their Odour, purge, heal, fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, The Colours us'd by Painters are certainly very florid, and the Mixture agreeable; and yet so 'tis in some Medicinal Compositions too. Wherein then lies the difference? Why, in the End or Use for which they are designed: the one purely for Pleasure, the other for Profit. In like manner the Civilities of one Friend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, besides the main Point of their Honesty, and mutual Advantage, are always attended with an over-plus of Delight and Satisfaction. Nay, they can now and then indulge themselves the Liberty of an innocent Diversion, a Collation, or a Glass of Wine; and believe me, can be as chearful and jocund as the best; all which they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46331:18"/> use only as Sauce, to give a Relish to the more serious and weighty Concernments of Life; to which purpose was that of the Poet:
<q>With pleasing Chat they did delight each other.</q> As likewise this to:
<q>Nothing could part our Pleasure, or our Love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the whole Business and Design of a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, is continually to entertain the Company with some Pastime or other, a little Jest, a Story well told, or a Comical Action; and in a word, he thinks he can never over-act the diverting part of Conversation. Where as the true Friend, proposing no other End to himself, than the bare discharge of his Duty, is sometimes pleasant, and as often, it may be, disagreeable, neither sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitously coveting the one, nor industriously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the other, if he judg it the more season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and expedient. For as a Physician, if need require, will throw in a little Saffron or Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard to qualify his Patient's Dose, and will now and then bathe him, and feed him up curiously; and yet again another time will prescribe him <hi>Castor,</hi> or
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Poley,</hi> which the strongest Scent doth yield,</l>
                     <l>Of all the Physic-Plants which cloath the Field.</l>
                  </q> Or perhaps will oblige him to drink an Infusion of Hellebore, neither proposing the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the one, nor the nauseousness of the other, as his scope and design, but only conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by these different Methods, to one and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46331:18"/> the same End, the Recovery of his Health. In like manner the real Friend sometimes leads his Man gently on to Vertue by kindness, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and extolling him; as he in <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dear <hi>Teucer,</hi> thou who art in high Command,</l>
                     <l>Thus draw the Bow with thy unerring Hand.</l>
                  </q> And another, speaking of <hi>Ʋlysses;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Shall not <hi>Ulysses</hi> in my memory shine,</l>
                     <l>Whose Vertues are so God-like and Divine;</l>
                  </q> And again, when he sees Correction requisite, will check him severely; as,

                     <l>By being an high-born Fool, and nobly vain?</l>
                  </q> And perhaps is forc'd another time to second hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Words with Actions: As <hi>Menedemus</hi> reclaim'd his Friend <hi>Asclepiades</hi>'s Son, a dissolute and debauch'd young Gentleman, by shutting his Doors upon him, and not vouchsafing to speak to him. And <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> forbad <hi>Battus</hi> his School, for having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused <hi>Cleanthes</hi> in a Comedy of his; but after he had made satisfaction, and an acknowledgment of his Fault, took him into favour again. For we ought to grieve and afflict our Friend, with design meerly of serving him, not of making a Rupture betwixt us; and must apply our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, only as pungent and acute Medicines, with no other intent than the Recovery of the Patient. And therefore a Friend, like a skilful Musician, who, to tune his Instrument, winds up one String, and lets down another, grants
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46331:19"/> some things, and refuses others, according as their Honesty or Usefulness prompt him; whereby he often pleases, but is sure always to profit: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Parasite, who is continually upon the same humouring String, knows not how to let fall a cross Word, or commit a disobliging Action, but servilely complys with all your desires, and is always in the Tune you ask for. And therefore as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reports of <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> that he took some delight in being prais'd by those who would upon occasion dispraise him too: So ought we to judg, that he only rejoyces and pleases us really as a Friend, who will, when Need requires, thwart and contradict us; must suspect their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who aim at nothing but our gratification, without the least intermixture of Reprehension; and indeed ought to have that Repartee of a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> ready upon such occasions, who hearing King <hi>Charillus</hi> highly extoll'd for an excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, asked, <hi>How he could be so good a Man, who was never severe to an ill one?</hi> They tell us, that Gad-flies, creep into the Ears of Bulls, and Tiques into those of Dogs: but I am sure the Parasite lays so close Siege, and sticks so fast to the Ears of the Ambitious, with the repeated Praises of their Worth, that 'tis no easy matter to shake him off again. And therefore it highly concerns them to have their Apprehensions awake, and upon the guard, critically to remark, whether the high Characters such Men lavish out, are intended for the <hi>Person</hi> or the <hi>Thing</hi> they would be thought to commend. And we may indeed suppose them more peculiarly design'd for the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they bestow them on Persons absent ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than present; if they covet, and aspire after the same Qualities themselves, which they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46331:19"/> in others; if they admire the same Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the rest of Mankind, as well as in us; and are never found to faulter and bely, either in Word or Action, the Sentiments they have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And, what is the surest <hi>Creterion</hi> in this Case, we are to examine, whether or no we are not really troubled at, or ashamed of the commission of those very Things for which they applaud us, and could not wish that we had said or acted the quite contrary: for our own Consciences, which are above the reach of Passion, and will not be put upon by all the sly Artifices of Flattery, will witness against us, and spurn at an undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Commendation. But I know not how it comes to pass, that several Persons had rather be pittied then comforted in Adversity; and when they have committed a Fault, look upon those as Enemies and Informers, who endeavour to chide and lecture them into a Sense of their Guilt, but caress and embrace them as Friends, who sooth them up in their Vices. Indeed they who continue their Applauses to so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a thing as a single Action, a wise Saying, or a smart Jest, do only a little present Mischief; but they who from single Acts proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch even the Habits of the Mind with their immoderate Praises, are like those treacherous Servants, who not content to rob the common Heap in the Granary, filch even that which was chosen and reserved for seed. For whilst they entitle Vice to the Name of Vertue, they corrupt that prolific Principle of Action, the Genius and Disposition of the Soul, and poison the Fountain whence the whole Stream of Life derives. <hi>Thucidides</hi> observes That in the time of War and Sedition the Names of Good and Evil
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46331:20"/> are wont to be confounded: As Fool-hardiness is called a generous Espousal of a Friend's Quarrel; a provident Delay is nicknam'd Cowardise; Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, a meer Pretext for Unmanliness; a prudent slow Inspection into Things, down-right Laziness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner, if you observe it, a Flatterer terms a profuse Man, liberal; a timerous Man, wary; a dull Fellow, grave; a stingy Miser, frugal; an amorous Youngster, kind and good-natured; a passionate proud Fool, stout; and a mean-spirited Slave, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and observing. As <hi>Plato</hi> somewhere remarks, That a Lover, who is always a Flatterer of his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Object, stiles a Flat-Nose, amiable; an Hawk-Nose, princely; the Black, virile; and the Fair, the Off-spring of the Gods: and observes particularly, that the Appellation of <hi>Hony-coloured,</hi> is nothing but the dawb of a Gallant, who is willing to set off his <hi>Mistresse's</hi> pale Complexion. Now indeed an ugly Fellow, banter'd into an Opinion that he's hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, or a little Man magnified into tall and portly, cannot lie long under the Mistake, nor receive any great Injury by the Cheat: But when Vice is extoll'd by the Name of Vertue, so that a Man is induced to sin, not only without regret, but with joy and triumph, and is hardned beyond the modesty of a Blush for his Enormities; this sort of Flattery, I say, has been fatal even to whole Kingdoms. 'Twas this ruin'd <hi>Scicily,</hi> by stiling the Tyranny of <hi>Dionysius</hi> and <hi>Phalaris,</hi> nothing but Justice, and an hatred of villanous Practices. 'Twas this that overthrew <hi>Egypt,</hi> by palliating the King's Effeminacy, his Yellings, his Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Rants, and his drawing the Figures of musical Instruments upon his Body, with the more plausible Names of true Religion, and the Worship of the Gods. 'Twas this that had very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46331:20"/> nigh ruined the stanch Roman Temper, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the Voluptuousness, the Luxury, the sumptuous Shows, and public Profuseness of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> into the softer Terms of Humanity, good Nature, and the Generosity of a Gentleman, who knew how to use the Greatness of his Fortune. What but the Charms of Flattery made <hi>Ptolemy</hi> turn Piper and Fidler? What else put on <hi>Nero</hi>'s Buskins, and brought him on the Stage? Have we not known several Princes, if they sung a tolerable Treble, term'd <hi>Apollo's?</hi> when they drank stoutly, stiled <hi>Bacchu's;</hi> and upon Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Fencing, or the like, immediately dub'd by the Name of <hi>Hercules?</hi> Hurried on by those empty Titles, to the Commission of those Acts which were infinitely beneath the dignity of their Character? And therefore it will be then more especially our concern to look about us, when a Flatterer is upon the strain of praising; which he is sensible enough of and accordingly avoids all occasion of suspicion, when he attacks us on that side. If indeed he meets with a tawdry Fop, or a dull Country-Clown in a Leathern Jacket, he plays upon them with all the liberty imaginable: As <hi>Strathias</hi> insulted and triumph'd over the Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishness of <hi>Bias,</hi> when he told him that he had out-drunk King <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, and with that, turning about to <hi>Cyprias,</hi> burst out into Laughter. But if he chance to fall upon an apprehensive Man, who can presently smoak a design, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he thinks he has and Eye upon him, and stands upon his Guard, he does not immediately assault him with an open Panegyric, but first fetches a Compass, and softly winds about him, till he has in some measure tamed the untractable Creature, and brought it to his hand: For he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46331:21"/> either tells him what high Characters he has heard of him abroad (introducing, as the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians do, some third Person); how upon the Exchange t'other day he happily overheard some Strangers, and Persons of great gravity and worth, who spake extreme honourably of him, and professed themselves much his Admirers: Or else he forges some frivolous and false Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and then coming in all haste, as if he had heard it really reported, asks him serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he can call to Mind where he said or did such a thing? and immediately upon his denial of the matter Fact, which he has Reason enough to expect, take occasion to fall upon the Subject of his Commendation. <hi>I wondred indeed,</hi> says he, <hi>to hear that you should calumniate your Friend, who never used to speak ill of your Enemies: that you should endeavour to rob another Man of his Estate, who so generously spend your own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others again, like painters who enhance the Lustre and Beauty of a curious Piece, by the Shades which surround it, slily extol and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Men in their Vices, by deriding and railing at their contrary Vertues. Thus in the Company of the Debauch'd, the Covetous, and the Extortioner, they run down Temperance and Modesty as meer Rusticity; and Justice, and Contentment with our present Condition, argue nothing in their Phrase but a dastardly Spirit, and an Impotence to Action. If they fall into the Acquaintance of Lubbers, who love Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ease, they stick not to explode the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Administration of Public Affairs, as a troublesome intermedling in other Mens Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a desire to bear Office, as an useless empty Thirst after a Name. To wheedle in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46331:21"/> with an Orator, they scout a Philosopher; and who so gracious as they with the Gilts of the Town, by laughing at Wives who are faithful to their Husband's Beds, as impotent and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-bred? And, what's the most egregious Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of all the rest, the Flatterer shall traduce himself, rather than want a fair Opportunity to commend another: As Wrestlers put their Body in a low Posture, that they may the better worst their Adversaries. <hi>I am a very Coward at Sea,</hi> says he) <hi>impatient of any Fatigue, and cannot digest the least ill Language; but such an one fears no Colours, has no Fault, is an admirable good Man, bears all things with great Patience, and Evenness of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> If he meets with one who abounds in his own Sense, and who affects to appear rigid and singular in his Judgement, and as an Argument of the Rectitude and Steadiness thereof, is aways telling you of that of <hi>Homer:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Let not your Praise, nor Dispraise lavish be,</l>
                     <l>Good <hi>Diomede,</hi> when e're you speak of me.</l>
                  </q> He applies a new Engine to move this great Weight; to such a one he imparts some of his private Concerns, as being willing to advise with the ablest Counsel, he has indeed a more intimate Acquaintance with others, but he was forc'd to trouble him at present: For to whom <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hould we poor witless Men have recourse (says he) when we stand in need of Advice? or whom else should we trust? And as soon as he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Opinion, whether it be to the purpose or no, he takes his Leave with seeming Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as if he had received an Answer from an Oracle. Again, if he perceives a Man pretends
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46331:22"/> to be Master of a Stile, he presently presents him with something of his own composing, requesting him to peruse and correct it. Thus <hi>Mithridates</hi> could no sooner set up for a Physician, than some of his Acquaintance desired to be cut and cauterized by him; a piece of Flattery that extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Falacy of bare Words, imagining that he must needs take it as an Argument of the great Opinion they had of his Skill, that they durst trust themselves in his Hands. Now to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Cheat which these Insinuations of our own worth might put upon us (a thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no ordinary Circumspection) the best way will be to give him a very absurd Advice, and to animadvert as impertinently as may be upon his Works, when he submits them to your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: for if he makes no Reply, but grants and approves of all you assert, and applauds every Period with the Elogy of <hi>very right! incomparable well!</hi> then you have trappann'd him, and 'tis plain, that though
<q>
                     <l>He Counsel ask'd, he play'd another Game,</l>
                     <l>To swell you with th' Opinion of a Name.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed. As some have defin'd Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be mute Poetry; so there is a sort of silent Flattery, as expressive as the loudest Encomiums. For, as Hunters are then surest of their Game, when they pass under the Disguise of Travellers, Shepherds, or Husbandmen, and seem not at all intent upon their Sport: so the Elogies of a Parasite never take more effectually, than when he seems least of all to commend you. For he who rises up to a Rich Man, when he comes in Company; or who, having begun a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46331:22"/> Motion in Parliament, suddenly breaks off, and gives some Leading Man the Liberty of speaking his Sense first in the Point; such a Man's Silence more effectually shews the Deference he pays the other's Judgment, then if he had avowedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it. And hereupon you shall have them always placed in the Boxes at the Play-house, and pearch'd upon the highest Seats at other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Entertainments, not that they think them suitable to their Quality; but meerly for the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gratifying great Men by giving them place. Hence it is likewise, that they open first in all Solemn and Publick Assemblies, and by and by complement another into the Chair, as an abler Speaker; and retract their Opinion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, if any Person of Authority, Riches, or Quality contradict them: So that you may perceive all their Concessions, Cringes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to be but meer Courtship and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, by this easy Observation, that they are usually paid to Riches, Honour, or the like, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Age, Art, Vertue, or other Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Endowments.</p>
               <p>Thus dealt not <hi>Apelles</hi> with <hi>Megabizus</hi> (one of the <hi>Persian</hi> Nobility) who pretending once to talk I know not what about Lines, Shades, and other things peculiar to his Art: the Painter could not but take him up, telling him, That his Apprentices yonder, who were grinding Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, gazed strangely upon him, admiring his Gold and Purple Ornaments, while he held his Tongue, but now could not chuse but titter to hear him offer at a Discourse upon an Argument so much out of his Spear. And when <hi>Craesus</hi> asked <hi>Solon</hi> his Opinion of Felicity, he told him flatly, that he looked upon <hi>Tellus,</hi> an honest
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46331:23"/> (though obscure) <hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> and <hi>Cleobis,</hi> happier than he. But the Flaterer will have Kings, Governours, and Men of Estates, not only the most signally happy, but the most eminently know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the most vertuous, and the most prudent of Mankind: And therefore some of them cannot endure to hear those Rants of the Stoicks, who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all true Riches, Generosity, Nobility and <hi>Royalty</hi> it self in the Person of a wise Man: For 'tis the Man of Monys that's both <hi>Orator</hi> and <hi>Poet</hi> with them; and, if he pleases <hi>Painter</hi> and <hi>Fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And therefore I like the Observation of <hi>Carneades,</hi> who used to say, That young Princes and Noble-Men never arrived at a tolerable Perfection in any thing they learn'd, except riding the great Horse; for their Preceptors spoil them at School by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling all their Performances, and their Masters in the <hi>Academies</hi> usually take the Foil: whereas the Horse, who knows no distinction betwixt a private Man and a Magistrate, betwixt the Rich and the Poor, will certainly throw his Rider, if he knows not how to sit him, let him be of what Quality he pleases. And therefore 'twas but impertinently said of <hi>Bion</hi> upon this Subject, that he, who could praise his Ground into a good Crop, were to blame if he bestowed any other Tillage upon't. 'Tis granted: nor is it improper to commend a Man, if you do him any real Kindness by't; but here's the Disparity: That as a Field is not capable of Improvement,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46331:23"/> so neither of Disservice by any Commendations bestow'd upon't: Whereas a Man immoderately praised, is puffed up, burst, and ruined by't.</p>
               <p>Thus much then for the Point of praising;<note place="margin">The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Friend and a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</note> Proceed we in the next place to treat of Freedom in their Reprehensions. And indeed, 'twere but reasonable, that as when <hi>Patroclus</hi> put on <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Armour, and led his War-Horse out into the Field, yet durst not for all that venture to weild his Sphear: So, though the Flatterer wear all the other Badges and Ensigns of a Friend, he should not dare to counterfeit the plain Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Discourse, as being a great, massy and substantial Weapon, peculiar to him.</p>
               <p>But because to avoid that Scandal and Offence, which their drunken Bouts, their little Jests, and ludicrous babling Humour might otherwise cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, they sometime put on the Face of Gravity, and flatter under the Vizard of a Frown, dropping in now and then a Word of Correction and Reproof; let us examine this Cheat too amongst the rest.</p>
               <p>And indeed I can compare that triffling insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Liberty of Speech, which he pretends to, to nothing better than that Sham <hi>Hercules,</hi> which <hi>Menander</hi> introduces in one of his Comedies, with a light hollow Club upon his Shoulder; for as Womens Pillows, which seem sufficiently stuff'd to bear up their Heads, yield and sink under their Weight; so this counterfeit Freedom in a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer's Conversation swells big, and promises fair, that when it shrinks and contracts it self, it may draw those in with it, who lay any stress upon its outward Appearance: whereas the genuine and friendly Reprehension fixes upon real Criminals, causing them Grief and Trouble indeed, but only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46331:24"/> what is wholsom and salutary; like Honey that corrodes, but yet cleanses the ulcerous Parts of the Body, and is otherwise both pleasant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. But of this in its proper place. We shall discourse at present, of the Flatterer, who affects a morose, angry, and inexorable Behaviour towards all but those, upon whom he designs; Is peevish and difficult towards his Servants, animadverts se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely upon the Failures of his Relations and Domesticks, neither admires nor respects a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but superciliously contemns him; pardons no Man, but by Stories and Complaints exasperates one against another, thinking by these means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Character of an irreconcileable Enemy with all manner of Vice, that he may be thought one who would not spare his Favourites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon occasion; and indeed a Person who neither acts nor speaks any thing, out of a mean and dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ard Complaisance.</p>
               <p>And if at any time he undertakes his Friend, he feigns himself a meer Stranger to his real and considerable Crimes; but if he catch him in some petty triffling Piccadillo, there he takes his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to rant him terribly, and thunder him severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off: <hi>If he sees any of his Goods out of order, if his House be not very convenient, if his Beard be not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or his Cloaths unfashionable, if his Dog or his Horse be not well looked after,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>if he slights his Parents, neglect his Children, treat his Wife scornfully, his Friends and Acquaintance disrespectfully, and squander away his Estate;</hi> here he dares not open his Mouth, and it's the safest way to hold his Tongue: Just as if the Master of a Wrestling School should indulge his young Champion Schollar in Drinking and Wenching, and yet rattle him about his Oil-cruise, and Body-brush: Or, as if a School-master should whip a Boy for some little
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46331:24"/> fault in his Pen or Writing-book, but takes no notice of the Barbarisms and Solecisms in his Language. For the Parasite is like him, who hearing a ridiculous impertinent Orator, finds no fault with his Discourse, but Delivery; blaming him only for having spoiled his Voice with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold Water: Or, like one who being to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use and correct some pitiful Scrible, falls foul on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Courseness of the Paper, and the Blots and Negligence of the Transcriber. Thus the Parasites about <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> when he pretended to Learning, would wrangle with him till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night about the Propriety of an Expression, a Verse, or a Story; but not a word all this while of his Cruelty, Insults, Superstition and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the People. Just as if a Chyrurgion should pair a Man's Nails, or cut his Hair, to cure him of a Fistula, Wen, or other carnous Excrescence. But there are others behind, who out-do all the Subtilty of the former, such as can claw and please, even whilst they seem to reprehend. Thus when <hi>Alexander</hi> had bestowed some considerable Reward upon a Jester, <hi>Agis</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> through meer Envy and Vexation, cry'd out upon't as a most absurd Action; which the King over-hearing, he turn'd him about in great Indignation at the Insolence, saying, <hi>What's that you prate, Sarrah?</hi> Why truly replied the Man, I must confess, I am not a little troubled to observe that all you great Men, who are descended from <hi>Jupiter</hi> take a strange delight in Flatterers and Buffoons: For as <hi>Hercules</hi> had his <hi>Cercopians,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> his <hi>Silenians</hi> about him; so I see your <hi>Majesty</hi> is pleas'd to have a regard for such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Fellows too. And one time when <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> was present at the Senate, there stood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46331:25"/> up a certain fawning Counsellor, asserting, That all free born Subjects ought to have the Liberty of speaking their Sense freely, and should not dissemble or conceal any thing that they might conceive beneficial to the Publick, who having thus awakened the Attention of his Audience. Silence being made, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> impatient to hear the Sequel of the Man's Discourse, pursued it in this manner: <hi>I must tell you of a Fault,</hi> Caesar, (said he) <hi>for which we universally blame you, though no Man yet has taken the confidence to speak it openly; You neglect your self, endanger your sacred Person by your too much Labour and Care, Night and Day, for the Publick.</hi> And having harangued several things to the same effect, 'tis reported that <hi>Cassius Severus</hi> the Orator should subjoin <hi>[This Man's Freedom of Speech will ruin him.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Artificers as these, I confess, are not very pernicious, but there remains one of a most dangerous consequence to weak Men; and that is, when a Flatterer shall fasten those Vices upon them, which are directly contrary to those they are really guilty of. As <hi>Himerius,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Parasite, upbraided one of the most miserable and stingy Misers of the whole Town, with Carelesness and Prodigality, telling him, He was afraid he should live to see the day when both he and his Children should go a begging. Or on the Contrary, when they object Niggardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Parsimony to one that's lavish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse; as <hi>Titus Petronius</hi> did to <hi>Nero:</hi> or when they advise Arbitrary and Tyranical Princes to lay aside their too much Moderation, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and unseasonable Clemency. These are they who shall pretend to be aware of a half-witted Idiot, as of some notable shrew'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46331:25"/> Fellow; and shall tax an ill natured censorious Man, if at any time he speak honorably of a Person of Worth, of being too lavish in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations: <hi>You are always praising,</hi> say they, <hi>Men that deserve it not; for who is he, or what remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing did he ever say or do?</hi> But they have yet a more signal Opportunity of exercising their Talent, when they meet with any difference betwixt Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or Friends: For if they see Brothers quarrel, or Children despise their Parents, or Husbands jealous of their Wives, they neither admonish them of, nor blame them for it, but inflame the Difference: <hi>You do not understand your self,</hi> say they, <hi>you are the Occasion of all this Clutter by your own soft and submissive Behaviour.</hi> If there chance to have happened some little Love-Skirmish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Miss and her Gallant, then the Flatterer interposes boldly, and adds fresh Fuel to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Flame, taking the Gentleman to task, and telling him how many things he has done, which looked a little hard, were not kind, and deserved a Chiding.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Ʋngrateful Man, can you forget her Charms,</l>
                  <l>And former soft Embraces in her Arms?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Friends perswaded <hi>Antony,</hi> smitten with his beloved <hi>Egyptian,</hi> that she doted on him still, calling him haughty and hard-hearted Man: She, said they, has stript her self of the Glories of a Crown, and former Grandure, and now languishes with the Love of you, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Motion of your Camp, in the poor fordid Figure of a Concubine;
<q>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:46331:26"/>
                     <l>But you have steel'd your Heart, and can unmov'd,</l>
                     <l>Behold her grief, whom once you so much lov'd.</l>
                  </q> Now he was strangely pleased to hear of his little Unkindnesses to his Mistriss, and was more taken with such a Chiding, than with the highest Character they could have given him; but was not sensible, that, under the Colour of a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Admonition, they really corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd him. For such a Rebuke as this, is just like the Biles of a lecherous Woman; for it only tickles and provokes, and pleases, even whilst it pains you. And as pure Wine, taken singly, is an excellent Antidote against Hemlock; but if mix'd with it, renders the Poyson incurable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Heat of the Wine quickens its Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Heart: So some rascally Fellows, knowing very well that the Liberty of reproving a Friend, is a Quality very hardly compatible with Flattery, and, as I may say, the best Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, mix them both together, and flatter you under the very Colour and pretext of reprimand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole therefore, <hi>Bias</hi> seems not to have answered him very pertinently, who asked him, Which he thought was the most hurtful Animal? when he replied, <hi>That of wild Creatures, a Tyrant, and of tame ones, a Flatterer:</hi> For he might have answered more accurately, that some Flatterers indeed are tame Creatures, those Shirks, who ply about your Bath, and your Table; but they whose Calumnies, Malignity and Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive medling Humor, like so many Gins and Snares, reach the Ladies very Closets and Bed-Chambers,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46331:26"/> these are wild, savage and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Now one way of arming our selves against these Assaults, will be always to remember,<note place="margin">How to arm our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> that since our Souls are made up of two different Parts; the one sincere, honest and reasonable; the other brutish, false, and govern'd by Passion: the Friend always adapts his Advice and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Improvement of the better part, like a good Physician, who preserves and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an healthful Constitution where he finds it; whilst the Flatterer claws and tickles the irrational Part of the Man only, debauching it from the Rules of right Reason, by the repeated Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of soft and sensual Delights.

               <p>But if we find it something difficult to discover him in these Attempts upon our Passions, because they often violently over-power all the Forces of our Reason to the contrary; we may then trace him in other Instances of his Knavery, for he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acts consonant to himself: As if you are afraid of a Surfeit, and thereupon be in suspense about your Bath and Diet, a Friend indeed will advise you to act cautiously, and take care of your Health; but the Flatterer perswades you to the Bath, bids you feed freely, and not starve your self with Mortification. If he observes you want Briskness and Spirit for Action, as being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey, a Voyage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He'll tell you presently, There's no hast, the Business may be well enough deferr'd, or else transacted by Proxy. If at any time you have promised to lend or give a Friend a Sum of Money, and upon second thoughts gladly would, and yet are ashamed to retract your Word; the Flatterer puts his Advice into the worst Scale, and inclines the Ballance to the saving Side, strips you of your squemish Modesty, telling you, That you ought not to be so prodigal, who live at great Expences, and are willing to relieve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers besides him. And therefore unless we be more Strangers to our selves, to our own Desires, Fears, Confidence, or the like, the Flatterer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily escape our Discovery; for he's the great Patron of these disorderly Passions, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring always to wind us up to Excesses of this Kind. But enough of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The difference betwixt the good Offices they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</note> Let us, in the next place, discourse of the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and kind Offices, which the Flatterer seems so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46331:27"/> chearfully ready upon every occasion to perform, that it renders the Disparity betwixt him and the true Friend extreamly perplext and intricate.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Euripides</hi> says of Truth, <hi>That it loves plain Language:</hi> So the Temper of a Friend is sincere, natural, without Paint or Varnish; but that of a Flatterer, as it is corrupt and diseased in it self, so stands it in need of many, and those cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and exquisite Remedies too, to correct it. And therefore you shall have Friends upon an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Rancounter, without either giving or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a formal Salute, content themselves to speak their mutual Kindness and Familiarity in a Nod and a Smile: But the Flatterer pursues you, runs to meet you, and is ready to kiss your hand before he comes at you; and if you chance but to see and salute him first, he swears you must excuse his Rudeness, and will produce you Witness that he did not see you, if you please. Thus again; A Friend dwells not upon every trifling Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, is not ceremonious and punctual in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of Business, is not inquisitive, nor intrudes into every piece of Service: But the Parasite is all Obedience, all perpetual indefatigable Industry, admits no Rival in his Services, but will wait your Commands, which if you lay not upon him, he seems mightily afflicted, the unhappiest Man in the World!</p>
               <p>Now these Observations are Argument enough to convince a Man of any tolerable Sence, that the Friendship such Men pretend to, is not really Vertuous and Chast, but rather a sort of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent whorish Love, that obtrudes its Embraces upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, as to their Promises.</note> But to be more particular, let us first examine the Disparity betwixt their Promises: For our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46331:28"/> Fore-fathers well observed, that the Offers of a Friend run in such Terms as these:
<q>
                     <l>If I can serve you, Sir, if your Request</l>
                     <l>Be feasible by me, I'll do my best.</l>
                  </q> But the Flatterer's thus;
<q>Command me freely what you will, I'll do it.</q> For the Comedians introduce such brave Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers as these:
<q>
                     <l>Come, Sir, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et me but fight that Fellow there;</l>
                     <l>I'll beat him soft as Spunge, or Gellies are.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, no real Friend will assist in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Design, unless, being first advised with, he approve of it, as either honest or useful: Whereas the Flatterer, though permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and give his Opinion about an Undertaking, not only out of a paltry Desire to comply with, and gratifie his Friend at any rate; but lest he should be look'd upon as disaffected to the Business, servilely closes with, and advances his Proposals, how unreasonable soever. For there are few Rich Men or Princes of this Mind,
<q>
                     <l>Give me a Friend, though a poor Beggar he,</l>
                     <l>Or meaner than the meanest Beggar be.</l>
                     <l>If he his Thoughts but freely will impart,</l>
                     <l>And boldly speak the Language of his Heart.</l>
                  </q> For they, like Actors in a Tragedy, must have a <hi>Chorus</hi> of their Friends to joyn with them in the Concert, or else the Claps of the Pit to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46331:28"/> them: Whereupon <hi>Merope</hi> in the Tragedy speaks thus:
<q>
                     <l>Make choice of those for Friends, who never knew,</l>
                     <l>The Arts of Wheedling and betraying you:</l>
                     <l>But those poor Rascals never entertain,</l>

You shall have some of them indeed more plain and simple than the rest, who confess themselves unworthy to consult about such weighty Affairs, but are ready to serve you in the executive part of a Design: But the more subtil Hypocrite comes in at the Consult, knits his Brows, declares his Consent by the Gravity of a Look or a Nod, but speaks ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Word, unless perchance, when the <hi>Great Man</hi> delivers his Opinion, he cries, <hi>Lord! Sir, you prevented me, I was just a going to say so.</hi> For as the Mathematicians tell us, that Surfaces and Lines, which are incorporeal, and Creatures of the Understanding only, are neither bended, nor moved, nor extended of themselves, but are so affected together with the Bodies, whose Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities they are: So you shall observe the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer attends only the Motion of another's Sense, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, Passion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any Principle of Action in himself.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46331:29"/> Friend, like the noblest Faculties of an animate Creature, lie deep, without any Parade or Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry on the Outside: Nay, many times, as a faithful Physician cures his Patient when he least knows of it; so a true Friend, either present or absent, as occasion serves, is sollicitous about your Concerns, when perhaps you know nothing of it. Such was the excellent <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> as in other his Actions, so particularly in his Kindness to <hi>Apelles,</hi> Native of <hi>Chios,</hi> whom finding extreamly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his Sickness, he repeated his Visit to him with twenty Drachms in his Pocket; and sitting by his Bed-side, <hi>You have got nothing here,</hi> said he, <hi>but</hi> Empedocles<hi>'s Elements, Fire, Water, Earth, and the surrounding Air; neither methinks do you lie easily:</hi> And with that, stirring up his Pillow, put the Money privately under his Head: Which when the good old Woman his Nurse found, and and in great Admiration acquainted <hi>Apelles</hi> with; <hi>Ay,</hi> says he, smiling a little, <hi>this is a Piece of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesilaus<hi>'s Thievery.</hi> And what Philosophy tells us, that Children usually resemble their Parents, we find in some measure verified in <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> and <hi>Lacydes,</hi> his intimate Acquaintance: For when <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi Socrates</hi> was impeached of High-Treason, and <hi>Lacydes,</hi> with several others of his Friends, stood by him at his Tryal, the Counsel for the State desired the Prisoners Ring, wherein lay the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Evidence against him, might be produced in Court, which <hi>Cephi Socrates</hi> hearing, dropt it soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off his Finger, and <hi>Lacydes</hi> observing it, set his Foot upon't, and buried it in the Ground. Whereupon being acquitted, and going after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to pay his Respects and thanks to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; one of them, who, it seems, had took notice of the Passage, told him, that his Thanks were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46331:29"/> owing to <hi>Lacydes,</hi> and so related the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when yet <hi>Lacydes</hi> had never mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Thus I am verily perswaded that the Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer several Benefits upon us which We are not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, upon no other Motive in the World, than the meer Pleasure and Satisfaction they take in Acts of kindness and Beneficence.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, the seemingly good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Flatterer have nothing of that Sincerity and Integrity, that Simplicity and Ingenuity, which recommend a Kindness; but are always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Bustle and Noise, Hurry, Sweat and contracting the Brow, to enhance your Opinion of the great Pains he has taken for you; like a Picture drawn in gawdy Colours, with folded torn Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, full of Angles and Wrinkles, to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it an elaborate Piece, and done to the Life.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Flatterer is so extreamly trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, in recounting the weary Steps he had taken, the Cares he has had upon him, the Persons he has been forced to oblige, with a thousand other Inconveniences he has laboured under upon your Account, that you'll be apt to say, the Business was never worth all this Din and Clutter about it.</p>
               <p>For a Kindness once upbraided, looses its Grace, turns a Burden, and becomes intolerable. But the Flatterer not only reproaches us with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices already past, but at the very Instant of their Performance; whereas if a Friend be obliged to speak of any Civility done another, he modestly mentions it indeed, but attributes nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Thus when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> supplied the People of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in great Scarcity of Provisions, and they gratefully resented and extoll'd the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>Why,</hi> replied the <hi>Spartans, 'twas no such
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46331:30"/> great matter, we only robb'd our selves and our Cattel of a Dinner.</hi> For a Favour thus bestowed, is not only free and ingenuous, but more acceptable to the Receiver, because he imagines his Benefactor conferred it on him without any great Prejudice to himself.</p>

For a Friend must not, as <hi>Gorgias</hi> would have him, beg ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Assistance in a just Undertaking, and then think to compensate the Civility, by contributing to several that are unjust; for he is not bound to bear a part in the Follies of his Friend, but rather to disswade him from them: And if, after all, he cannot prevail upon him, may disengage himself with the Reply of <hi>Phocion</hi> to <hi>Antipater; Sir, I cannot be both your Friend, and your Flatterer; that is, your Friend, and not your Friend at the same time.</hi> For we ought to be assistant to him in his honest Endeavours indeed, but not in his Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; in his Counsels, not in his Tricks; in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as Evidence for him, but not in a Cheat; and must bear a share in his Misfortunes, but not in his Acts of Injustice. For if a Man ought not to be as much as conscious of an Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Friend, how much less will it become him to partake in it? Therefore, as when the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> defeated by, and treating of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Peace with <hi>Antipater,</hi> pray'd him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them any thing, howsoever grievous and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46331:30"/> burthensome to the Subject, provided it were not base and dishonorable: So a Friend, if you want his Assistance in a chargeable, dangerous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Enterprize, imbarks in the Design chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and without reserve; but if such as will not stand with his Reputation and Honour, he fairly desires to be excused. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you offer to put a Flatterer upon a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult or hazardous Employment, he shuffles you off, and begs your Pardon. For sound him but, as you rap a Vessel, to try whether it be whole or crackt, full or empty; and he shams you off with the Noise of some paltry, frivolous Excuses: But en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in any mean, fordid and inglorious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, abuse him, kick him, trample on him, he bears all patiently, and knows no Affront. For as the Ape, who cannot keep the House like a Dog, or bear a Burden like an Horse, or plow like an Ox, serves to be abus'd, to play the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon, and to make Sport: So the Parasite, who can neither plead your Cause, nor be your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, nor espouse your Quarrel, as being averse from all painful and good Offices, denies you in nothing that may contribute to your Pleasure, turns Pander to your Lust, Pimps for a Whore, provides you a handsome Entertainment, looks that your Bill be reasonable, and sneaks to your Miss; but shall treat your Relations with Dis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and impudently turn your Wife out of Doors, if you Commission him. So that you may easily discover him in this Particular; for put him upon the most base and dirty Actions, he will not spare his own Pains, provided he can but gratifie you.</p>

For there's nothing more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a true and cordial Acquaintance, than to love with, and to be beloved of many; and therefore he always sedulously endeavours to gain his Friend the Affections and Esteem of other Men. For being of Opinion that all things ought to be in common amongst Friends, he thinks nothing ought to be more so, then they themselves. But the Faithless, the Adulterate, and Friend of base Alloy, who is conscious to himself of the Dis-service he does true Friendship, by that false Coin of it which he puts upon us, is naturally full of Emulation and Envy, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those of his own Profession, endeavouring to out-do them in their common Talent of Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Buffoonry, whilst he reveres and cringes to his Betters, whom he dares no more vie with, than a Foot-man with a <hi>Lydian</hi> Chariot, or Lead (to use <hi>Simonide</hi>'s Expression) with refined Gold. Therefore this light and empty Counterfeit, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he wants Weight, when put into the Ballance against a sollid and substantial Friend, endeavours to remove him as far as he can; like him, who having painted a Cock extreamly ill, commanded his Servant to take the Original out of sight, and if he cannot compass his Design, then he proceeds to Complement and Ceremony, pretending outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to admire him, as a Person far beyond himself, whilst by secret Calumnies he blackens, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines him; which if they chance to have gall'd and fretted him only, and have not throughly done his Work, then he betakes himself to the Advice of <hi>Medius,</hi> that Arch-Parasite, and Enemy to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Nobility, and Chief of all that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Train which <hi>Alexander</hi> entertained in his Court. This Man taught his Disciples to slander
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46331:31"/> boldly, and push home their Calumnies, for though the Wound might probably be cured, and skinned over again, yet the Teeth of Slander would be sure to leave a Scar behind them; by these Scars (or to speak more properly) Gangrenes and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of false Accusations, fell the brave <hi>Callisthenes, Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi> whilst he himself became an easie Prey to an <hi>Agnon, Bagoas, Agesius,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who trick'd him up like a <hi>Barbarian</hi> Statue, or Antick, and paid the Mortal the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration due to a God. So great a Charm is Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and, as it seems, the greatest with those we think the greatest Men; for the exalted Thoughts they entertain of themselves, and the Desire of an universal Concurrence in the same Opinion from others, both add Courage to the Flatterer, and Credit to his Impostures. Hills and Mountains indeed are not easily taken by Stratagem or Ambuscade; but a weak Mind, swoln big and lofty by Fortune, Birth, or the like, lies naked to the Assaults of every mean and petty Aggressor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">He now proceeds from the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt a Flatterer and a Friend, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Tract with a Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures vvhich the latter ought to observe in his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</note> And therefore we repeat here what we advised at our entrance into this Discourse, that we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire every vain Opinion of our selves, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Flattery only disposes and prepares us to a more favorable Reception of that from without. For, if we did but square our Actions according to the famous Oracular Precept of <hi>knowing our selves,</hi> rating things according to their true intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Value, and withal, reflecting upon our own Nature and Education; consider what gross Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and Failures mix with our Words, Actions and Affections, we should not lye so open to the Attempts of every Flatterer, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs upon us. For even <hi>Alexander</hi> himself being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46331:32"/> reminded of his Mortality by two things especially, the Necessity of Sleep, and the use of Women, began to stagger in the Opinion they had made him conceive of his God-head. And did but we in like manner take an impartial Survey of those Troubles, Lapses and Infirmities incident to our Nature, we should find we stood in no need of a Friend to praise and extol our Vertues, but of one rather that would chide and reprimand us for our Vices. For first, there are but few who will venture to deal thus roundly and impartially with their Friend, and fewer yet who know the Art of it; Men generally, mistaking Railing, and ill Language, for a decent and friendly Reproof; and then a Chiding, like any other Physick, ill timed, racks and torments you to no purpose, and works in a manner the same Effect with Pain, that Flattery does with Pleasure. For an unseasonable Reprehension may be equally mischievous with an unseasonoable Commendation, and force your Friend to throw himself upon the Flatterer; like Water which meeting with too forcible a Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Hills, rowls down upon the humble Valleys below: and therefore we ought to qualifie, and to allay the sharpness of our Reproofs with a due Temper of Candor and Moderation, as we would refract a Ray of Light too powerful for a distempered Eye, lest our Friends being plagu'd and ranted upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial occasion, should at last fly to the Flatterer's Shade for their Ease and Quiet. For all Vice, <hi>Philopappus,</hi> is to be corrected by an intermediate Vertue, and not by its contrary Extream, as some do, who to shake off that sheepish Bashfulness which hangs upon their Natures, learn to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, to lay aside their Country Breeding, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46331:32"/> to be Comical; to avoid the Imputation of Softness and Cowardise, turn Bullies; out of an Abhorrence of Superstition, commence Atheists; and rather than be reputed Fools, play the Knave; forcing their Inclinations, like a crooked Stick, to the opposite Extream, for want of Skill to set them streight.</p>
               <p>Since then 'tis highly rude to endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Suspition of Flattery, only by being insignificantly troublesome, and argues an ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel, unconversable Temper in a Man, to show his just Abhorrency of mean and servile Ends in his Friendship, only by a sowr and disagreeable Behaviour; like the Libertine in the Comedy, who would needs perswade himself, that his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accusations fell within the Limits of that Freedom in Discourse, which every one had right to with his Equals. Since therefore, I say, 'tis absurd to incur the Suspicion of a Flatterer by an over-obliging and obsequious Humor; and as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd on the other hand, in endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it by an immoderate Latitude in our Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, to lose the Enjoyments, and salutary Admonitions of a friendly Conversation; and that the Measures of Just and Proper in this, as in other things, are to be taken from Decency and Moderation; the Nature of the Argument seems to require me to conclude it with a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>Now seeing this Liberty of animadverting on other Mens Failures is liable to so many Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; let us in the first place carefully purge it from all mixture of Self-love<note place="margin">We must first purge our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all mixture of Self-love▪</note> and Interest, lest any private Motive, Injury, Grudge or Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own should seem to incite us to the Undertaking: For such a Chiding as this would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46331:33"/> not pass for an Effect of Kindness, but of Passion, and looks more like a Complaint, than an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: For the latter has always something in it that sounds kind, and yet awful, whereas the other betrays only a selfish and narrow Disposition. And therefore we usually honour and revere our Monitor, but contemn and recriminate upon a querulous Accuser. As <hi>Agamemnon</hi> could by no means digest the moderate Censures of <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet bore well enough with the severe Reprimands of <hi>Ʋlysses:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Who wish'd in Wrath the General's Command,</l>
                     <l>No longer put in such a desperate Hand.</l>
                  </q> Being satisfied of his Wisdom, and good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for he rated him purely upon the account of the Publick, the other upon his own. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> himself, though of a rough and untractable Disposition, and ready enough to find Faults where there were none; yet heard <hi>Patroclus</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently when he ranted him thus:
<q>
                     <l>Well sure, great <hi>Peleus,</hi> that Man of worth,</l>
                     <l>Did ne're beget, nor <hi>Thetis</hi> bring thee forth:</l>
                     <l>But Rocks, hard as thy Heart, and th'angry Sea,</l>
                     <l>Both club'd for such a monstrous Man as Thee.</l>
                  </q> For as <hi>Hyperides</hi> the Orator desired the <hi>Athenians</hi> to consider not only the Sharpness of his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but his great Reasons for them: so the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of a Friend, proceeding from a sincere and disinteressed Affection, create all Veneration and Confusion in the Criminal to whom they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed; who, if he once perceive that his Friend, waving all Offences against himself, chides him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46331:33"/> purely for those committed against others, can never hold out against the Force of so powerful a Rebuke, for the sweet and obliging Temper of his Monitor gives a keener Edge to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; and therefore it has been wisely said, that especially in Heats and Differences with our Friends we ought to have a peculiar regard to their Honour and Interest. Nor is it a less Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Friendship, for a Man who is said aside, and out of Favour himself, to turn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in behalf of another, equally despised and neglected. As <hi>Plato,</hi> being in Disgrace with <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius,</hi> beg'd Audience of him; which he readily granting, in expectation of being entertained with an Account of his Grievances; <hi>Plato</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd himself to him after this manner: <hi>Sir</hi> said he, <hi>if you were inform'd there were a certain Ruffian come over into your Island of</hi> Sicily, <hi>with design to attempt upon your Majesties Person, but, for want of an Opportunity, could not execute the Villany, would you suffer him to go off unpunished? No, by no means,</hi> Plato replied, the King, <hi>for we ought not only to detest, and revenge the Overt-Acts, but the malicious Intentions of our Enemies.</hi> Well then, on the other hand said <hi>Plato, If there should come a Person to Court, out of pure Kindness and Ambition to serve your Majesty, and you would not give him an Opportunity of expressing it, were it reasonable to dismiss him with Scorn and Disrespect?</hi> Whom do you mean, said <hi>Dionysius?</hi> why <hi>Aeschines,</hi> replied <hi>Plato,</hi> as honest and excellent a Person as any in the School of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and of a very edifying Conversation; who having exposed himself to the Difficulties of a tedious Voyage, that he might enjoy the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Philosophical Converse with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, has met with nothing but Contempt in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46331:34"/> return to the Kindness be intended. Which friendly and generous Temper of Mind so strangely affected <hi>Dionysius,</hi> that he hug'd and embraced <hi>Plato,</hi> and treated <hi>Aeschines</hi> with a great deal of Honour and Magnificence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2dly, We must not be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abusive in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>In the next place, let us free our Discourse from all contumelious Language, all Laughter, Monkery, and Scurrility, which spoil the relish of our Reprehensions. For, as a Chyrurgion makes an Incision in the Flesh, he uses decent Neatness and Dexterity in the Operation, without the affected and superfluous Gesticulations of a Quack, or Mountebank: So the lancing the Sores of a Friend may admit indeed of a little Humour and Urbanity, but that so qualified, that it spoil not the Seriousness and Gravity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the Work. For boldness, Insolence and ill Language destroy its Force and Efficacy. And therefore the Fidler reparteed handsomely enough upon <hi>Philip,</hi> when he undertook to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him about the touch upon his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>God forbid that your Majesty should be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to understand a Fiddle better then I do.</hi> But <hi>Epicarmus</hi> was too blunt upon <hi>Hierom,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting him to Supper a little after he had put some of his Acquaintance to death, replied; <hi>Ay, but you could not invite me the other day to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of my Friends.</hi> And so was <hi>Antiphon</hi> too rude in his Reflection upon <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who on occasion of a Discourse about the best sort of Brass, told him that was the best in his Opinion of which the <hi>Athenians</hi> made the Statues of <hi>Hermodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogeiton.</hi> For these scurrilous abusive Jests are most certainly disagreable; and pain to no purpose, being but the Product of an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Wit, and which only betray the Enmity and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46331:34"/> ill-Nature of him who takes the liberty to use them, which whosoever allows himself in, does but wantonly sport about the Brink of that Pit, which one day will swallow him up and ruine him. For <hi>Antiphon</hi> was afterward executed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Dionysius:</hi> and <hi>Timagines</hi> was in disgrace with <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> not for any extravagant Freedom in his Discourse, but only because he took up a foolish Custom of repeating these Verses at every Entertainment and Walk where the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his Company;
<q>
                     <l>For nothing else but meerly to make sport,</l>
                     <l>Amongst the merry <hi>Greeks</hi> they did resort—</l>
                  </q> Alledging the Pleasantness of his Humour, as the Cause of his Favour at Court.</p>
               <p>Thus you shall meet with several smart and satyrical Reflections in a Comedy, but the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Jest and Fool in the Play, like ill Sauce to good Meat, abates their Poinancy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We may do well therefore to reserve our Jollity and Mirth for more suitable Occasions; but we must by all means be serious and candid in our Admonitions; which, if we be upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points, must be so animated with our Gestures, Passion, and Eagerness of Voice, as to give them Weight and Credit,<note place="margin">3dly, We are to time our Reproofs as season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as we can.</note> and to awaken a tender Concern in the Persons to whom they are address'd.</p>
               <p>We are again to time our Reproofs as seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as we can; for a Mistake in the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46331:35"/> as 'tis of ill Consequence in all other things, so peculiarly in our Reprehensions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I presume 'tis manifest, we ought not to fall foul upon Men in their Drink. For first, he who broaches any sowr disagreeable Discourse amidst the Pleasantry and good Humor of Friends, casts a Cloud over the Serenity of the Company, and acts counter to the <hi>Lydian</hi> God, who as <hi>Pindar</hi> words it, <hi>unites the Band of all our Cares.</hi> Besides, that such unseasonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances are not without Danger: for Wine is apt to warm Men into Passion, and make them quarrel at the Freedom you take; and in short, 'tis no Argument of any brave and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but rather of an unmanly Temper, not to dare to speak ones Sense when Sober, but drunk, and grumble like a cowardly Cur at Table. And therefore we need not enlarge any further upon this Topick. But because several Persons neither will, nor dare take their Friends to task, whilst they thrive and flourish in the World, looking upon Prosperity as a State above the reach of a Rebuke; but pour forth their Invectives like a River that has over-flown its Banks, insulting and trampling upon them, when Fortune has already laid them at their Feet, out of a sort of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to see their former State and Grandure reduc'd to the same level of fortune with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: it may not be improper to discourse a little upon this Argument, and make some reply to that Question of <hi>Euripides;</hi>
                  <q>What need is there of Friends in Prosperity?</q> I answer, to lower those lofty and extravagant Thoughts, which are usually incident to that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46331:35"/> Condition: for Wisdom, in Conjunction with Prosperity, is a rare Talent, and the lot of but few. Therefore most Men stand in need of a borrow'd Prudence; to depress the Tumours that attend an exuberant Felicity; but when the turn of Fortune it self has abated the swelling, a Man's very Circumstances are sufficient of themselves to read him a Lecture of Repentance; so that all other grave and austere Correptions are then superfluous and impertinent; and 'tis, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, more proper in such Traverses of Fortune, to enjoy the Company of a compassionate Friend, who will administer some Comfort to the afflicted, and buoy him up under the Pressure of his Affairs: As <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates that the Presence of <hi>Cleachus,</hi> a Person of a courteous and obliging Aspect, gave new Life and Courage to his Souldiers in in the Heat of a Battel, or any other difficult Rencounter. But he who chides and upbraids a Man in distress, like him who applies a Medicine for clearing the Sight to a distemper'd and inflamed Eye, neither works a Cure, nor allays the Pain, but only adds Anger to his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and exasperates the Patient. A Man in Health indeed will digest a friendly Lecture for his Wenching, Dringing, Idleness, continual Recreations and Bathing, unseasonable Eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for a sick Man to be told, that all this comes of his Intemperance, Voluptuousness, High-feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whoring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is utterly insupportable, and worse than the Disease it self. O impertinent Man! will such an one say, the Physicians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe me Castor and Scammony, and I am just a making my last Will and Testament, and do you lie railing and preaching to me Lectures of Philosophy? And thus Men in Adversity stand
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46331:36"/> more in need of our Humanity and Relief, than of sharp and sententious Reprimands: for neither will a Nurse immediately scold at her Child that is faln, but first help him up, wash him and put him in order again, and then chide and whip him. They tell us a Story to this purpose of <hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> that when he dwelt an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile at <hi>Thebes,</hi> in mean beggarly Circumstances, he was once extreamly concern'd to observe the Philosopher <hi>Crates</hi> making towards him, expecting to be treated by him with all the roughness of a Cynical Behaviour: But when <hi>Crates</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself courteously to him, and discoursed him upon the Point of Exile, endeavouring to convince him that it had nothing miserable or uneasy in it, but on the contrary, rather rescued him from the nice and hazardous Management of Publick Affairs; advising him withal to repose his Confidence in himself, and his own Conscience: <hi>Demetrius</hi> was so taken and encouraged by his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that he is reported to have said to his Friends, Cursed be those Employs which robb'd me so long of the Acquaintance of such an excellent Person. For,
<q>
                     <l>Soft, friendly Words revive th' Afflicted Soul;</l>
                     <l>But sharp Rebukes are only for a Fool.</l>
                  </q> And this is the way of generous and ingenious Friends. But they who servilely admire you in Prosperity, like old Ruptures, Spasms and Cramps, which, as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> speaks, ache and pain us most, and when some fresh Misfortune has befallen the Body, stick close to you in the Revolution of your Fortune, and rejoyce and enjoy the Change: Whereas, if a Man must needs have a Remembrancer of a Calamity which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46331:36"/> his own Indiscretion hath pull'd upon him, 'tis enough you put him in mind that he ows it not to your Advice, for you often disswaded him from the Undertaking.</p>
               <p>Well then, you'll say when is a keen Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension allowable? and when may we chide a Friend severely indeed? I answer; When some important Occasion requires it: as the stopping him in the Gareer of his Voluptuousness, Anger, or Insolence; the repressing his Covetous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or any other foolish Habit. Thus dealt <hi>Solon</hi> with <hi>Croesus,</hi> puff'd up and debauch▪d with uncertain Greatness of his Fortune, when he bad him look to the End. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> humbled <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> forc'd him into unfeigned Tears, and turn'd his Heart, when he argued the Case with him. Such, again, were the Remonstrances and Admonitions of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and of <hi>Plato</hi> to <hi>Dion,</hi> who, when the Lustre and Greatness of his Atchievements had fixed all Mens Eys upon him, wish'd him to beware of Arrogance and Self-conceit, as the readiest way to make all Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon him. And <hi>Speucippus</hi> wrote to him, Not to pride himself in the little Applauses of Women and Children, but to take care to adorn <hi>Sicily</hi> with Religion, Justice and wholsom Laws, that he might render it a great and illustrious Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy. So did not <hi>Euclus</hi> and <hi>Eulaeus,</hi> two of <hi>Perseus</hi>'s Favourites, who fawn'd upon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with him, as obsequiously as any Courtier of them all, during the Success of his Arms; but after his Defeat at <hi>Pydna</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd bitterly against him, reminding him of his past Faults, his former Fast and Arrogance, till the Man out of meer Anger and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, stab'd them both in the place. And so
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46331:37"/> much concerning the timing of our Reproofs in general.</p>

                     </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences a Friend may take occasion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</note>Now there are several other accidental Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons administred by our Friends themselves, which a Person heartily sollicitous for their Interest, will lay hold of: As some have taken an opportunity of censuring them freely, from a Question they have asked, from the relation of a Story, or the Praise or Dispraise of the same Actions in other Men, which they themselves have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Thus they tell us, <hi>Demaratus</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> when <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Queen and Son were at Odds; and being, after a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reception, ask'd by the King, What good Understanding was among the <hi>Graecians?</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as being an old Friend and Acquaintance of his, <hi>Ay, by all means, Sir, it highly becomes your Majesty, to enquire about the Concord betwixt the</hi> Athenians <hi>and</hi> Peloponesians, <hi>who suffer your own Family to be the Scene of so much Discord and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And as pert, was that of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who, entring <hi>Philip</hi>'s Camp, as he was going to make War upon the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was seiz'd upon and brought before the King, who not knowing him, ask'd him, If he was a Spie? <hi>Why yes truly,</hi> said he, <hi>I am a Spie upon your Folly and Imprudence, who, without any necessity upon you, are come hither to expose your Kingdoms, and your Life to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Decision of the Cast of a Dye.</hi> Though this may perhaps seem a little too biting and Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p>Another seasonable Opportunity of reproving your Friend for his Vices,<note place="margin">Another Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of repriman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> is, when some third Person has already mortified him upon the same account: For a courteous and obliging Man will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46331:37"/> dexterously silence his Accuser, and then take him privately to task himself, advising him, if for no other reason, yet to abate the Insolence of his Enemies, to manage himself more prudently for the future: <hi>For how could they open their Mouths against you, what could they have to reproach you with, if you would but reform such and such Vices, which render you obnoxious to their Censure?</hi> And by this means the Offence that was given, lies at his door who roughly upbraided him, whilst the Advantage he reaps, is attributed to the Person who candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advis'd him. But there are some who have got yet a genteeler way of Chiding, and that is, of chastising others for Faults, which they know their Friends really stand guilty of: As my Master <hi>Amonius,</hi> perceiving once at his After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon-Lecture, that some of his Scholars had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more plentifully than became the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Students, immediately commanded one of his Freemen to take his own Son, and whip him; <hi>For what,</hi> says he, <hi>the Youngster, forsooth must needs have Vinegar Sawce to his Meat;</hi> and with that, casting his Eye upon us, gave us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that we likewise were concerned in the Reprehension.</p>
               <p>Again; We must be cautious how we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke a Friend in Company,<note place="margin">We must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke a Friend in Company.</note> always remembring the Repartee made upon <hi>Plato</hi> on that account: For <hi>Socrates</hi> having fal'n one day very severely upon an Acquantance of his at Table, <hi>Plato</hi> could not forbear to take him up, saying, <hi>Had it not been more proper, Sir, to have spoke these things in private?</hi> To whom <hi>Socrates</hi> instantly replied, <hi>And had it not been more proper for you to have told me so in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate too?</hi> And they say <hi>Pithagoras</hi> one time ranted a Friend of his so terribly before Company, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46331:38"/> the poor young Man went and hang'd himself; from which time the Philosopher would never chide any Man in the presence of another. For the Discovery and cure of a Vice, like that of a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Disease, ought to be in secret, and not like a publick Show transacted upon a Theater; for 'tis no way the part of a Friend, but a meer Cheat and Trick, for one Man to recommend himself to the Standers-by, and seek for Reputation from the Failures of another; like Mountebank-Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions, who perform their Operations on a Stage, to gain the greater Practice. But besides the Disgrace that attends a Reproof of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (a thing that will never work any Cure) we are likewise to consider, that Vice is Naturally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, and loves to dispute its Ground: For what <hi>Euripides</hi> says, is not only true of Love,
<q>The more 'tis check'd, the more it presses on,</q> but of any other Imperfection. If you lay a Man open publickly for it, and tell all, you are so far from reforming him, that you force him to brave it out. And therefore as <hi>Plato</hi> advises, that old Men, who would be revered of the younger Fry, must learn to revere them first: so certainly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly to reprimand, is the way to meet with a modest Return. For he who warily attacks the Criminal, works upon his good Nature by his own, and so insensibly undermines his Vices. And therefore 'twould be much more proper to observe the Rule in <hi>Homer;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>To wisper softly in the Ear,</l>
                     <l>Lest Standers-by should chance to hear.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46331:38"/> But above all, we ought not to discover the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of a Husband before his Wife, nor of a Father before his Children, nor of a Lover in company of his Mistress, nor of Masters in presence of their Scholars, or the like; for it touches a Man to the quick, to be rebuked before those who he desires should think honourably of him. And I verily believe, that 'twas not so much the Heat of the Wine, as the Sting of too publick a Reprehension, that enraged <hi>Alexander</hi> against <hi>Clitus.</hi> And <hi>Aristomenes, Ptolemy</hi>'s Preceptor, lost himself by awaking the King, drop'd asleep one time at an Audience of Foreign Embassadors; for the Court-Parasites immediately took this occasion to express their pretendedly deep resentments of the Disgrace done his Majesty, suggesting, that if indeed the Cares of the Government had brought a little unseasonable Drowsiness upon him, he might have been told of it in private, but should not have had rude hands laid upon his Person before so great an Assembly: Which so affected the King, that he presently sent the poor Man a Draught of Poison, and made him drink it up. And <hi>Aristophanes</hi> says, <hi>Cleon</hi> blamed him for railing at <hi>Athens</hi> before Strangers, whereby he incensed the <hi>Athenians</hi> against him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who aim at the Interest and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Friends, rather then Ostentation and Popularity, ought, amongst other things,<note place="margin">He who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought to be a Man of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> to beware of exposing them too publickly.</p>
               <p>Again; What <hi>Thucidides</hi> makes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> say of themselves, <hi>That they were Persons every way qualified for the Reprehension of other Men,</hi> ought to be the Character of every one who sets up for a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For as <hi>Lysander</hi> reply'd upon a certain <hi>Megarian,</hi> who in a Council of Allies and Confederates had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46331:39"/> spoke boldly for the Liberties of <hi>Greece; This Stile of yours, Sir, would have better become some Pab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ick State, than a private Person.</hi> So he who takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Liberty of a Censor, must be a Man of a regular Conversation himself; one like <hi>Plato,</hi> whose Life was a continued Lecture to <hi>Speusippus;</hi> or <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> who casting his Eye one time upon the dissolute <hi>Polemon,</hi> at a Disputation, reformed him with the very Awfulness of his Looks. Whereas the Remonstrance of a lewd whiffling Fellow will certainly meet with no better Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, than that of the old proverbial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee,
<q>Physician, heal thy self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But because several accidental Emergencies in Conversation will now and then invite a Man,<note place="margin">They who reprehend others, ought likewise to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> though bad enough himself, to correct others, the most genteel and dextrous way of doing it, will be to involve our selves in the same Guilt with those we reprehend; as in this passage of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Fie, what's the matter, <hi>Diomede,</hi> that we</l>
                     <l>Have now forgot our former Gallantry?</l>
                  </q> And in this other,
<q>We are not worth one single <hi>Hector</hi> all.</q> Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> would handsomly twit the young Men with their ignorance, by professing his own, pretending for his part he had need with he n to study Morality, and make more accurate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the Truth of Things. For a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46331:39"/> of the same Guilt, and a seeming Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reform our selves, as well as our Friends, gives credit to the Reprimand, and recommends it to their Affections: But he who gravely magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himself, whilst he imperiously detracts from others, as being a Man, forsooth, of no Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, unless his Age, or a celebrated Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed command our Attention, is only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and troublesom to no purpose. And therefore 'twas not without reason, that <hi>Phaenix,</hi> checking <hi>Achilles</hi> for his imtemperate Anger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd his own Unhappiness in that Particular, how he had like once to have slain his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through a transport of Passion, had not the scandalous Name of Paracide held his hands; that the Heroe might not imagine he took that liberty with him, because he had never offended in the like kind himself. For such inoffensive Reproofs leave a deeper impress behind them, when they seem the Result of Compassion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Contempt.</p>
               <p>But because a Mind subject to Disorders of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note place="margin">We must mix our Reproofs with Praises.</note> like an inflamed Eye that cannot bear a great and glaring Light, is impatient of a Rebuke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some temperament to qualify and allay its Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; therefore the best Remedy in this Case will be to dash it with a little Praise. For a mixture of both together not only abates and takes off from that Roughness and Command, which a blunt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension seems to carry along with it, but raises in a Man a generous Emulation of himself, whilst the remembrance of his past Vertues shames him out of his present Vices, and makes him propose his former Actions for his future Example. But if you compare him with other Men, as with Fellow-Citizens, his Contemporaries, or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46331:40"/> then Vice, which loves to dispute the Victory renders him uneasy and impatient under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, and will be apt to make him grumble, and, in an Huff, bid you be gone then, to his Betters, and not trouble him any longer. And there we ought to fall upon other Mens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, before him whom we take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to rebuke, unless indeed they be his Parents; as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in <hi>Homer:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Tydeus</hi> his Son has not his Father's Soul.</q> And <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> in the Tragedy called the <hi>Scyris,</hi> speaking to <hi>Achilles:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dost thou, who sprang from a brave <hi>Grecian</hi> Race,</l>
                     <l>By Spinning, thy great Ancestors disgrace?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We must not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon them that blame us.</note>'Tis in the next place very improper for a Man, immediately to retort or recriminate upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor; for this is the way only to occasion Heats and Animosities betwixt them, and will rather speak him impatient of any Reproof at all, than desirous to compensate the Kindness of one with another: And therefore 'tis better to take his Chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patiently for the present, and if he chance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to commit a Fault worth your remarking upon, you have then an opportunity of repaying him in his own Coin: For being reminded, without the least intimation of a former Pique or Dissatisfaction, that he himself did not use to overlook the Slips of his Friend, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Remonstrance favourably at your hands, as being the Return of Kindness, rather than of Anger and Resentment.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:46331:40"/>
               <p>Moreover, as <hi>Thucidides</hi> says,<note place="margin">We ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Friend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every trivial Fault.</note> that he is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a wise Man, and well advised, who will not venture to incur the Odium and Displeasure of any one, except for Matters of the highest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: So when we do undertake the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Office of Censor, it ought to be only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weighty and important Occasions. For he who is peevish and angry at every Body, and upon every trivial Fault, acting rather with the imperious Pedantry of a Schoolmaster, than the Discretion of a Friend, blunts the edg of his Reprehensions in Matters of an higher Nature, by squandring, like an unskilful Physitian, that keen and bitter, but necessary and sovereign Remedy of his Reproofs, upon many and sleight Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that require so exquisite a Cure. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wise Man will industriously avoid the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being a Person who is always chiding, and delights in finding Faults. Besides that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is of that little Humour, to animadvert upon every trifling Picadillo, only affords his Friend a fairer occasion of being even with him one time or another, for his grosser Immoralities: As <hi>Philotimus</hi> the Physician, visiting a Patient of his, who being troubled with an Inflammation in his Liver, shewed him his sore Finger, told him, his Distemper lay not at the root of his Nail. In like manner we may take occasion now and then to reply upon a Man, who carps at Trifles in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, his Diversions, Pleasantries, or a Glass of Wine; Let the Gentleman rather, Sir, turn off his Whore, leave off his Dicing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he's an admirable Person. For he who is dispens'd with in smaller Matters, more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives his Friend the liberty of reprimanding him for greater. But there is neither Child, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46331:41"/> Brother, nor Servant himself, able to endure a Man of a busie inquisitive Humour, who brawls perpetually, and is sowr and unpleasant upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconsiderable occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We ought to qualify our Friend by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for his ill ones.</note>But since a weak and foolish Friend, as <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> says of Old Age, has its strong, as well as feeble part, we ought to observe both, and chearfully extol the one, before we fall foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other. For as we first soften Iron in the Fire, and then dip it into Water, to harden it in a due Consistence: So after we have warm'd and moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Friend by a just Commendation of his Vertues, we may then safely temper him with a moderate Reprehension of his Vices; we may then say, Are these Actions comparable to the other? don't you perceive the Advantages of a vertuous Life? This is what we who are your Friends require of you: These are properly your own Actions for which Nature design'd you; but for the other,
<q>
                     <l>Let them for ever from you banish'd be,</l>
                     <l>To desert Mountains, or the raging Sed.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For as a Prudent Physician had rather recover his Patient with Sleep, and good Diet, than with Castor and Scammony: So a candid Friend, a a good Father, or Schoolmaster, will rather chuse to reform Mens Manners by Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than Reproofs. For nothing in the World renders our Corruptions so inoffensive, and withal so useful, as to address our selves to the Delinquent in a kind, affectionate manner: And therefore we ought not to deal roughly with him upon his denial of the Matter of Fact, nor hinder him from making his just Vindication; but we should
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46331:41"/> rather handsomly help him out in his Apology, and mollifie the Matter: As <hi>Hector</hi> to his Brother <hi>Paris:</hi>
                  <q>Ʋnhappy Man, by Passion over-rul'd:</q> Suggesting, that he did not quit the Field, in his Encounter with <hi>Menelaus,</hi> out of Cowardise, but meer Anger and Indignation.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Nestor</hi> speaks thus to <hi>Agamemnon;</hi>
                  <q>You only yielded to the great Impulse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For you did such a thing through Ignorance or Inadvertency, is, in my Opinion, a much more genteel Expression, than bluntly to say, You have dealt unjustly, or acted basely by me: And to advise a Man not to quarrel with his Brother, is more Civil, than to say, Don't you envy and malign him: And keep not Company with that Woman who debauches you, is softer Language than, Don't you debauch her.</p>
               <p>And thus you see with what Caution and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we must reprehend our Friends,<note place="margin">How to prevent ill Habits in our Friends.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming them from Vices to which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready subjected; whilst the Prevention of them doth require a clear contrary Method: For when we are to divert them from the Commission of a Crime, or to check a violent and headstrong Passion, or to push on and excite a phlegmatick lazy Humor to great Things, we may then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe their Failings to as dishonorable Causes as we please.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> when he would awaken the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Achilles,</hi> in one of <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Tragedies, tells him, That 'twas not the Business of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46331:42"/> that put him in such a Fret, as he pretended, but because he was now arrived within sight of the Walls of <hi>Troy.</hi> And when <hi>Achilles,</hi> in a great Chafe at the Affront, swore he would sail back again with his Squadron, and leave him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> came upon him again with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder:
<q>
                     <l>Come, Sir, 'tis not for this you'd sail away;</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Hector</hi>'s near, it is not safe to stay.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, by representing to the Bold and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, the danger of being reputed a Coward; the Temperate and Sober, a Debauchee; and the Liberal and Magnificent, Stingie and Sordid: we spur them on to brave Actions, and divert them from base and ignominious.</p>
               <p>Indeed when a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing is once done, and past Remedy, we ought to qualifie and attemperate our Reproofs, and commiserate, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand. But if it be a Business of pure preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of stopping a Friend in the Career of his Irregularities, our Applications must be vehement, inexorable, and indefatigable: For this is the proper Season for a Man to shew himself a true Monitor, and a Friend indeed; for we see that even Enemies reprove each other for Faults already committed. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> said pertinently enough to this purpose, That he who would act wisely, ought to be surrounded either with good Friends, or Flagrant Enemies; for the one always teach us to do well, and the other as constantly accuse us if we do ill.</p>
               <p>But certainly 'tis much more eligible to forbear the Commission of a Fault, by hearkning to the good Advice of our Friends, than afterwards to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46331:42"/> repent of it, by reason of the Obloquy of our Enemies: And therefore, if for no other Reason, we ought to apply our Reprehensions with a great deal of Art and Dexterity, because they are the most Sovereign Physick that a Friend can prescribe, and which not only require a due Mixture of Ingredients in the Preparation of them, but a seasonable Juncture for the Patient to take them in.</p>
               <p>But because, as it has been before observed, Reproofs usually carry something of Trouble and Vexation along with them, we must imitate skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Physicians, who, when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave made an Incision in the Flesh, leave it not open to the Smart and Torment that attends it, but chafe and foment it to asswage the Pain: So he who would admonish dextrously, must not immediately give a Man over to the Sting and Anguish of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, but endeavour to Skin over the Sore with a more mild and diverting Converse; like Stone Cutters, who, when they have made a Fracture in their Statues, polish and brighten them afterwards: But if we leave them in Pain with their Wounds and Resentments, and, as it were, the Marks of our Reproofs yet green upon them, they will hardly be brought to admit of any Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we shall offer for the future. And therefore they who will take upon them to admonish their Friends, ought especially to observe this main Point, Not to leave them immediately upon it, nor abruptly break off the Conference with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging and bitter Expressions.</p>

                  <hi>EPICƲRƲS</hi>'s great Confident and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, <hi>Golotes,</hi> set forth a Book with this Title to it, <hi>That according to the Tenets of the other Philosophers, it's impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to live.</hi> Now what occurr'd to me then to say against him, in the Defence of those Philosophers, hath been <hi>(a)</hi> already put into Writing by me: But since upon the breaking up of our Lecture, <hi>(b)</hi> several things have happened to be spoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Walks in further Opposition to his Party, I thought it not amiss to recollect them also, if for no other reason, yet for this one, That those may see, that will needs be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting of other Men, <hi>(c)</hi> they ought not to run cursorily over the Discourses and Writings of those they would disprove; nor by tearing out one
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46331:43"/> Word here, and another there, or by falling foul upon particular Passages without the Books, to impose upon the Ignorant and Unlearned. Now as we were leaving the School, to take a Walk (as our manner is) in the Green, <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> began to us: In my Opinion, the Debate was managed on our Side with more Softness, and less Freedom than was fitting; I am sure <hi>(d) Heraclides</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently signified his Disgust at us at parting, for saving our own Heads whole, while he was so warmly engaged against <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus.</hi> Yet you may remember, reply'd <hi>Theon,</hi> how you told them, <hi>Colotes</hi> himself, compared with the Rhetorick of those two Gentlemen, would appear the complaisantest Man alive: For when they have rak'd together the lewdest Terms of Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Tongue of Man ever used; as <hi>(e) Buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Trollings, Arrogancies, Whorings Assassinations, Whining Counterfeits, Cross-grain'd Fellows,</hi> and <hi>Block-heads;</hi> they fairly throw them into the Faces of <hi>Aristotle, Socrates, Pythagoras, Protagoras, Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus, Heraclides, Hipparchus,</hi> and which not, even of the best and most celebrated Authorities? So that should they pass for very knowing Men upon all other accounts, yet their very Calumnies and Reviling Language would bespeak them at the greatest distance from Philosophy imaginable: For Emulation can never enter that God-like Consort, nor such Fretfulness as wants Resolution to conceal its own Resentments. <hi>(f) Aristodemus</hi> then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd; <hi>Heraclides,</hi> you know is a great Philologist, and that may be the reason why he made <hi>Epicurus</hi> those Amends for the <hi>Poetick Din</hi> (so that Party stile Poetry) and for the <hi>Fooleries of</hi> Homer; or else, it may be, it was because <hi>Metrodorus</hi> had libell'd that Poet <hi>(g)</hi> in so many Books. But let us let
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46331:44"/> these Gentlemen pass at present, <hi>Zeuxippus,</hi> and rather return to what was charged upon the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers in the beginning of our Discourse, <hi>That it is impossible to live according to their Tenets:</hi> And I see not why we two may not dispatch this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair betwixt us, with the good Assistance of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for I find this Gentleman (meaning me) is already tir'd. Then <hi>Theon</hi> said to him,
<q>
                     <hi>(h)</hi> Our Fellows have that Garland from us won;</q> Therefore, if you please,
<q>Let's fix another Goal, and at that run.</q> We will e'en prosecute them at the Suit of the Philosophers, in the following Form: <hi>(i)</hi> We'll prove, if we can, <hi>That 'tis impossible to live a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable Life according to their Tenets.</hi> Bless me! (said I to him, smiling) you seem to me to level your Foot at the very Bellies of the Men, and to design to enter the List with them for their Lives, whilst you go about to rob them thus of their Pleasure; and they cry out to you:
<q>Forbear, w'are no good Boxers, Sir,</q> No, nor good Pleaders, nor good Senators, nor good Magistrates neither;
<q>Our proper Talent is to eat and drink,</q> And to excite such tender and delicate Motions in our Bodies, as may chafe our Imaginations to some jolly delight or gaity. And therefore you seem to me, not so much to take off (as I may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46331:44"/> say) the pleasurable part, as to deprive the Men of their very Lives, while you will not leave them to live pleasurably. Nay then, said <hi>Theon,</hi> if you thus comment upon me, <hi>(k)</hi> pray propose some other Question your self, that may be more to your mind. By no means, said I, I am for this, and shall not only hear, <hi>(l)</hi> but answer you too, if you shall require it: But I must leave it to you, which of you shall begin.</p>
               <p>Then, after <hi>Theon</hi> had spoken something to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himself, <hi>Aristodemus</hi> said, When we had so short and fair a Cut to our Design, how have you blockt up the Way before us, by preventing us from joyning Issue with the Faction at the very first, upon the single Point of <hi>Seemly</hi> and <hi>Decorous!</hi> For you must grant, it can be no easie matter to drive Men, already possest, that Pleasure is their utmost Good, yet to believe a Life of Pleasure impossible to be attain'd: But now the Truth is, that at what time they failed of living becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they fail'd also of living pleasurably; for to live pleasurably, and yet unbecomingly, is even by themselves allowed inconsistent. <hi>Theon</hi> then said, We may probably resume the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that in the Process of our Discourse; in the Interim we will make use of their Concessions. Now they suppose their last Good to lie about the Belly, and such other Conveyances of the Body, as let in Pleasure, and not Pain; and are of Opinion, that all the brave and ingenuous Inventions that ever have been, were contriv'd at first for the Pleasure of the Belly, or the good hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing such Pleasure, as the Sage <hi>Metrodorus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. By which, my good Friend, it is very plain, they found their Pleasure in a poor rotten and unsure Thing, and that is equally
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46331:45"/>
                  <hi>(m)</hi> perforated for Pains, by the very Passages they receive their Pleasures by, or rather indeed, that admits Pleasure but by a few, but Pain by all its Parts: For the whole of Pleasure is <hi>(n)</hi> in a manner in the Joynts, Nerves, Feet and Hands; and these are oft the Seats of very grievous and lamentable Distempers; as Gouts, corroding Rheums, Gangrenes, and putrid Ulcers. And if you apply to your self the exquisitest of Perfumes or Gusts, you will find but some one small part of your Body, that is finely and delicately touch'd, while the rest are many times fill'd with Anguish and Complaints. Besides, there is no part of us Proof against Fire, Sword, Teeth or Scourges, or insensible of Dolours and Aches: Yea, Heats, Cold and Feavers sink into all our Parts alike. But Pleasures, like Gales of soft Wind, move sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, one towards one Extream of the Body, and another towards another, and then go off in a Vapour. Nor are they of any long durance neither, but as so many glancing Meteors, are no sooner kindled in the Body, but they are quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. <hi>(a)</hi> As to Pain, <hi>Aeschylus</hi>'s <hi>Philoctetes</hi> affords us a sufficient Testimony:
<q>
                     <l>The cruel Viper will ne're quit my Foot,</l>
                     <l>Her dire, invenom'd Teeth have there ta'ne Root.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>(p)</hi> For Pain will not troll off as Pleasure doth, nor imitate it in its pleasing and tickling Touches: But as the Clover twists its perplext and winding Roots into the Earth, and through its Coursness abides there a long time: So Pain disperses and entangles its Hooks and Roots in the Body, and continues there, not for a Day or a Night, but for several Seasons of Years, if nor for some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of Olympiads, nor scarce ever departs,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46331:45"/> unless struck out by other Pains, as by stronger Nails. For who ever drank so long, as those that are in a Fever are a-dry? Or who was ever so long eating, as those that are besieged suffer Hunger? Or where are there any that are so long solaced with the Conversation of Friends, as Tyrants a racking and tormenting? Now all this is owing to the Baseness of the Body, and its natural Incapacity for a pleasurable Life; for it bears Pains better than it doth Pleasures, and is, with respect to those, firm and hardy, but, with respect to these, <hi>(q)</hi> feeble, and soon pall'd. To which add, That <hi>(r)</hi> if we touch a Life of Pleasure, these Men won't give us leave to go on, but will presently confess themselves, that the Pleasures of the Body are but short, or rather indeed but of a Moments continuance, if they do not design <hi>(s)</hi> to banter us, or else speak it out of Vanity. As when <hi>Metrodorus</hi> tells us, <hi>We many times spit at the Pleasures of the Body.</hi> Nay, <hi>Epicur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> saith, <hi>A wise Man, when he is Sick, many times laughs in the Extremity of his Distemper.</hi> With what consistence then can those that account the Pains of the Body so light and easie, think so highly of its Pleasures? For should we allow them not to come behind its Pains, either in duration or magnitude, they would not yet have their being without them: For <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath made the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of all that pains, the common Definition of them all; as if Nature had intended to advance the pleasurable part only to the Destruction of the painful, but would not have it improv'd any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Magnitude; and as if she only diverted her self with certain useless Diversifications, <hi>(t)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she hath once arrived to an Abolition of Pain. But now the Passage to this, conjoyn'd with an Appetence, which is the measure of Pleasure, is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46331:46"/> extreme short, and soon over. And therefore the Sense of their narrow Entertainment here, hath obliged them to transplant their last End from the Body, as from a poor and lean Soil, to the Mind, in hopes of producing there, as it were, <hi>(u)</hi> large Pastures, and fair Meadows of Delights and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>(w) For <hi>Ithac</hi> Isle is no fit Place,</l>
                  <l>For mettled Steeds to run a Race.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Neither can the Joys of our poor Bodies be sooth and equal, but on the contrary must be course and harsh, and immixt with much that is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing and inflam'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> then said, And do you not think then, they take the right course, to begin at the Body, where they observe Pleasure to have its first Rise, and thence <hi>(x)</hi> to pass to the Mind, as the more stable and sure part, there to compleat and crown the whole?</p>
               <p>They do, by <hi>Jove,</hi> I said; and, if after remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, they have indeed found something more consummate than before, a Course too as well agreeing with Nature, as becoming Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with both contemplative and civil Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But if after all this, you still hear them cry out, and protest, That the Mind of Man can receive no Satisfaction or Tranquility from any thing under Heaven, but from the Pleasures of the Body, either in Possession or Expectance, and that these are its proper and only Good; can you forbear thinking they make use of the Soul, but as <hi>(y)</hi> a fresh Cask for the Body, while they mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Pleasure by shifting it thither, as they rack Wine out of an old and leaky Vessel into a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46331:46"/> new one, and then imagine they have perform'd some extraordinary and very fine thing? True indeed <hi>(z)</hi> a fresh Pipe may both contain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Wine that Age hath decay'd; but the Mind, receiving but the remembrance only of past Pleasure, like a kind of Scent, retains that, and no more. For as soon as it hath given one Hiss in the Body, it immediately expires; and that little of it that stays behind in the Memory, is but flat, and like a queasie Fume: As if a Man should lay up and treasure <hi>(a)</hi> in his Fancy, what he either eat or drank yesterday, that he may have recourse to that when he wants fresh Fare. See now how much more temperate <hi>(b)</hi> the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naicks</hi> are, who, though they have drunk out of the same Bottle with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> yet will not allow Men so much as to practise their Amours by Candle light, but only under the Covert of the Dark, for fear Seeing should fasten too quick an Impression of the Images of such Actions upon the Fancy, and thereby too frequently inflame the Desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. But these Gentlemen account it the highest Accomplishment of a Philosopher, to have a clear and retentive Memory of all the various Figures, Passions, and Touches of past Pleasure. We will not now say, they present us with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy the Name of Philosophy, while they leave the Refuge of Pleasure in their wise Mans Mind, as if it could be a Lodging for Bodies. But that it's impossible such things as these should make a Man live pleasurably, I think abundantly manifest from hence: <hi>(c)</hi> For it will not perhaps seem strange, if I assert, That the Memory of Pleasure past brings no Pleasure with it, <hi>(d)</hi> at what time it seems little in the very Enjoyment, or to Men of that Abstinence <hi>(e)</hi> as to account it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46331:47"/> for their Benefit to retire from its first Approaches, when even the most amaz'd and sensual Admirers of Corporeal Delights, remain no longer in their gawdy and pleasant Humour, than their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure lasts them. What remains is but an empty Shadow and Dream of that Pleasure, that hath now taken Wing, and is fled from them, and that serves but for Fuel to foment their untam'd Desires: Like as in those that dream they are a-dry, or in Love, their unaccomplisht Pleasures and Enjoyments do but excite the Inclination to a greater Keenness. Nor indeed can the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of past Enjoyments afford them any real Contentment at all, but must serve only with the help of a quick Desire, to raise up very much of Outrage and stinging Pain out of the Remains of a feeble and befooling Pleasure. <hi>(f)</hi> Neither doth it befit Men of Continence and Sobriety, to exercise their Thoughts about such poor Things, or to do <hi>(g)</hi> what one twitted <hi>Carneades</hi> with, to reckon, as out of a Diurnal, how oft they have lain <hi>(h)</hi> with <hi>Hedeia,</hi> or <hi>Leontion,</hi> or where they last drunk <hi>Thasian</hi> Wine, or at <hi>(i)</hi> what twentieth-day Feast they had a costly Supper: For such Transports and Captivatedness of the Mind to its own remembrances, as this is, would shew a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorate and beastial Restlesness and Raving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the present, and hop'd for Acts of Pleasure. And therefore I cannot but look upon the Sense of these Inconveniences, as the true Cause of their retiring at last to a Freedom from Pain, and a firm State of Body; as if living pleasurably could lie in bare imagining this either past, or future to some Persons. True indeed it is, that a sound State of Body, and a good Assurance of its continuing, must needs afford a most trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46331:47"/> and solid Satisfaction to all Men capable of Reasoning. But yet look first what Work they make, while they course this same Thing, whether it be Pleasure, Exemption from Pain, <hi>(k)</hi> or good Health, up and down, first from the Body to the Mind, and then back again from the Mind to the Body, being compell'd to return it to its first Origin, lest it should run out, and so give them the slip. Thus they pitch the pleasur'd part in the Body, <hi>(l)</hi> (as they term it) upon the complacent part in the Mind, and yet conclude again with the good Hopes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent part hath in the pleasur'd. Indeed what Wonder is it, if when the Foundation shakes, the Superstructure totter? Or that there should be no sure Hope, nor unshaken Joy in a Matter that suffers so great Concussion and Changes, as continually attend a Body expos'd to so many Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and Strokes from without, and that hath within it the Origins of such Evils as Human Reason cannot avert. For if it could, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Man would ever fall under Stranguries, Gripes, Consumptions, or Dropsies; with some of which, <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself did conflict, and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aenus</hi> with others, and others of them were the Deaths of <hi>Neocles</hi> and <hi>(m) Agathobulus.</hi> And this we mention, not to disparage them, knowing very well that <hi>Pherecides</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent Persons, labour'd under very uncouth and calamitous Distempers. We only beg of them, if they will own their own Diseases, and not by noisy Rants and popular Harangues incur the Imputation of false Bravery, either not to take the Health of the whole Body for the Ground of their Content, or else not to say, that Men under the Extremities of Dolours and Diseases, can yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46331:48"/> rally and be pleasant. For a sound and hail Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Body is indeed a thing that often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but a firm and stedfast Assurance of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance can never befall an intelligent Mind. But as at Sea (according to <hi>Aeschylus.</hi>)
<q>
                     <hi>(n)</hi> Night to the ablest Pilot Trouble brings.</q> (And so will a Calm too, for no Man knows what will be) So likewise is it impossible for a Soul, that dwells in a healthful Body, and that places her Good in the Hopes she hath of that Body, to perfect her Voyage here without Frights or Waves. For Man's Mind hath not, like the Sea, its Tempests and Storms only from without it, but it also raises up from within far more and greater Disturbances. And a Man may with more reason look for constant fair Weather in the midst of Winter, than for perpetual Exemption from Afflictions in the Body. For what else hath given the Poets occasion to term us <hi>one day Animals, Ʋncertain</hi> and <hi>Ʋnfixt?</hi> and to liken our Lives to Leaves, that both spring and fall in the Compass of a Summer; but the unhappy, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous and sickly Condition of the Body, whose very utmost Good we are warn'd to dread and prevent? <hi>For an exquisite Habit, Hippocrates</hi> saith, <hi>is slippery and hazardous.</hi> And,
<q>
                     <l>He that but now look'd jolly, plump and stout,</l>
                     <l>Like a Star shot by <hi>Jove,</hi> is now gone out.</l>
                  </q> As it is in <hi>Euripides.</hi> And it is a vulgar Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that very handsome Persons, if seen first, oft suffer damage by Envy and an evil Eye; for that a Body at its utmost Vigour, will through
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46331:48"/> delicacy very soon admit of Changes. But now that these Men are miserably unprovided for an undisturbed Life, you may discern even from what themselves advance against others: For they say, that those that commit Wickedness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the Displeasure of the Laws, live in constant Misery and Fear; for that, though they may perhaps attain to Privacy, yet it is impossible they should ever be well assur'd of that Privacy: Whence the ever-impending Fear of the future will not permit them to have either Complacency or Assurance in their present Circumstances. But they consider not how they speak all this against themselves: For a sound and healthy State of Body they may indeed oftentimes possess; but that they should ever be well assur'd of its Continuance, is impossible, but must of necessity be in constant Disquiet and Pain for the Body, with respect to Futurity; and if not, why do they then look for a firm and stedfast Assurance from it, when <hi>(o)</hi> they know they could never yet attain it? But to do no Wickedness, will contribute nothing to our Assurance; for it is not suffering unjustly, but suffering in it self, that's dismaying: Nor can it be a matter of Trouble to be engaged in Villanies ones self, and not afflictive to suffer by the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies of others. Neither can it be said, that the Tyranny of <hi>Lachares</hi> was less, if it was not more calamitous to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and that of <hi>Dionysuis</hi> to the <hi>Syracusans,</hi> than they were to the Tyrants themselves: For it was disturbing, that made them be disturb'd; and their oppressing and pestering of others first, gave them occasion to expect to suffer ill themselves. Why should a Man recount the Outrages of Rabbles, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities of Thieves, or the Villanies of Inheritors,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46331:49"/> or yet the Contagions of Airs, and <hi>(p)</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of Seas, by which <hi>Epicurus</hi> (as himself writeth) was <hi>(q)</hi> in his Voyage to <hi>Lampsacus,</hi> within very little of drowning? The very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Body, it containing in it the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all Diseases, and (to use a Pleasantry of the Vulgars) <hi>cutting Thongs for the Beast out of its own Hide,</hi> I mean, Pains out of the Body, is sufficient to render Life perilous and uneasie, and that to the Good, as well as to the Bad, if they have learnt to place their Complacence and Assurance in the Body, and the hopes they have of it, and in nothing else; as <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath written, as well in many other of his Discourses, as in that <hi>Of Man's End.</hi> They therefore assign not only a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unsure Ground of their pleasurable Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but also one in all respects despicable and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if the escaping of Evils be the matter of their Complacence and last Good. But now they tell us, <hi>Nothing else can be so much as imagin'd, and that Nature hath no other Place to bestow her Good in, but only that out of which her Evil hath been driven;</hi> as <hi>Metrodorus</hi> speaks <hi>(r)</hi> in his Book <hi>against the Sophists.</hi> So that this single thing, to escape Evil, is their supreme Good; for there's no room to lodge this Good in, where no more of what's painful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting goes out. Like unto this is that of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> where he saith, <hi>The very Essence of Good arises from the escaping of Bad, and a Man's remembring, recollecting, and rejoycing within himself, (s) that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hath befallen him: For what occasions transcending Joy</hi> (he saith) <hi>is some great impending Evil escap'd, and in this lies the very Nature and Essence of Good, if a Man consider it aright, and contain himself when he hath dome, and not ramble and prate Idly about it.</hi> O the rare Satisfaction and Fidelity these Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46331:49"/> that can thus rejoyce for having undergone no Evil, nor endur'd either Sorrow or Pain! Have they not reason, think you, to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for such things as these and to say as they are wont, when they stile themselves <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortals,</hi> and <hi>Equals to Gods?</hi> And when through the Excessiveness and Transcendency of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Things they enjoy, they rave even to the degree of whooping and hollowing, for very satisfaction that to the shame of all Mortals they have been the only Men that could find out this Celestial and Divine Good, that lies in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from all Evil! So that their Beatitude differs little from that of Swine and Sheep, while they place it in a meer tolerable and contented State, either of the Body, or of the Mind upon the Body's account. For even the more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and airy sort of Brutes do not esteem <hi>(t)</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping of Evil their last End, but when they have taken their Repast, they are disposed next by Fullness to Singing, and they divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Swimming and Flying; and their Gaiety and Sprightliness prompt them to entertain themselves with attempting to conterfeit all sorts of Voices and Notes; and then they make their Caresses to one another, by skipping and dancing one towards another; Nature inciting them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have escap'd Evil, to look after some Good, or rather to shake off what they find unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy and disagreeing, as an Impediment to their pursuit of something better and more congenial. For what we cannot be without, deserves not the Name of Good; but that which claims our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and Preference, must be something beyond a bare Escape from Evil: And so, by <hi>Jove,</hi> must that be too, that's either agreeing or congenial to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46331:50"/> us, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> who will not allow us to give the Name of Pleasures to the bare Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Sorrows and Pains, but would have us look upon them rather as obscure Draughts and Mixtures of agreeing and disagreeing, as of black and white, while the Extreams would advance themselves to a milddle Temperament. But often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Unskilfulness and Ignorance of the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Extream, <hi>(u)</hi> occasions some to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the middle Temperament for the Extream and outmost Part: And thus do <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> while they make avoiding of Evil to be the very Essence and Consummation of Good; and so receive but as it were the Satisfaction of Slaves, or of Rogues, newly discharg'd the Goal, who are well enough contented, if they may but wash and supple their Sores, and the Stripes they receiv'd by whipping, but never in their Lives had one taste or sight of a generous, clean, unmixt and unulcerated Joy: For it follows not, that if it be vexatious to have one's Body itch, or one's Eye to run, it must be therefore a Blessing to scratch ones self, and to wipe ones Eyes with a Rag; nor that if it be bad to be dejected or dismay'd at Divine matters, or to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd with the Relations of Hell, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bare avoiding of all this must be some happy and amiable thing. The truth is, these Mens Opinion, though it pretends so far <hi>(w)</hi> to out-go that of the Vulgar, <hi>(x)</hi> allows their Joy but a strait and narrow Compass to toss and tumble in, while it extends it but to an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Fear of Hell, and so makes that the Top of acquired Wisdom, which is doubless natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Brutes. For if <hi>(y)</hi> Freedom from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pain be still the same, whether it come <hi>(z)</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:46331:50"/> by Endeavour or by Nature, neither then is an undisturbed State of Mind the greater for being attain'd to by Industry, than if it came by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: though a Man may with good reason main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that to be the more confirm'd Habit of the Mind, that naturally admits of no Disorder, than that which by Application and Judgment eschews it. But let us suppose them both equal, they will yet appear not one jot superior to the Beasts, for being unconcern'd at the Stories of Hell, and the Legends of the Gods, and for not expecting endless Sorrows and <hi>(a)</hi> everlasting Torments hereafter. For it is <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself that tells us, that (b) <hi>had our Surmiscs about the Meteors in the Air, and our foolish Apprehensions of Death, and the Pains that ensue it, given us no disquiet, we had not then needed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Nature for our Relief.</hi> For neither have the Brutes any weak Surmises of the Gods, or fond Opinions <hi>(c)</hi> about Things after Death, to disorder themselves with; nor have they as much as Imagination or Notion that there is any thing in these to be dreaded. I confess had they left us the benign Providence of God as a Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wise Men might then seem, by reason of of their good hopes from thence, to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards a pleasurable Life that Beasts have not: But now since they have made it the Scope of all their Discourses of God, that they may not fear him, but be eas'd of all concern about him, I much question, whether those that never thought at all of him, have not this in a more confirm'd degree than they that have learn'd to think he can do no harm: For if they were never freed from Superstition, they never fell into it; and if they never laid aside a disturbing Conceit of God, they never took one up. The
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46331:51"/> like may be said as to Hell, and the future State: For though <hi>(d)</hi> neither the Epicurean nor the Brute can hope for any Good thence; yet such as have no forethought of Death at all cannot but be less amus'd and scar'd with what comes after it, than they that betake themselves to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>(e) That Death is nothing to us.</hi> But something to them it must be, at least so far as they concern themselves to reason and contemplate about it: But now the Beasts are wholly exempted from thinking of what appertains not to them; and if they flie from Blows, Wounds and Slaughers, they fear no more in Death than is dismaying to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurean himself. Such then are the Things they boast to have at tained by their Philosophy. Let us now see what those are <hi>(f)</hi> they deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of, and chase away from them. For those Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Mind that arise from the Body, and the pleasing Condition of the Body, if they be but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, appear to have nothing in them that's either great or considerable; but if they be excessive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their being vain and uncertain, they are also importune and petulent; nor should a Man term them either mental Satisfactions or Gaities, but rather corporeal Gratifications, they being at best but the Simperings and Effeminacies of the Mind. But now such as justly deserve the Names of Complacences and Joys, are wholly refin'd from their contraries, and are immixt with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vexation, Remorse, nor Repentance; and their Good is congenial to the Mind, and truly mental and genuine, and not super-induc'd: Nor is it devoid of Reason, but most rational, as springing either from that in the Mind that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative and enquiring, or else from that Part of it that is active and heroick: Either of which,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46331:51"/> how many and how great Satisfaction it affords us, he that would, can never relate. But to hint briefly at some of them. We have the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans before us, which though they find us many and delightful Exercises, yet they still leave our Desire after Truth insatiate and uncloy'd with Pleasure, through which even Lies are not without the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Grace. Yea, Tales and Poetick Fictions, while they cannot gain upon our Belief, yet have something in them that's charming to us: For do but think with your self, with what a sting we read <hi>Plato's Atlantick,</hi> and the Conclusion of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and how we hanker and gape after the rest of the Tale, as when some beautiful Temple or Theater is shut up. But now the informing of our selves with the Truth her self, is a thing so delectable and lovely, as if our very Life and Being were for the sake of knowing. And the darkest and grimmest Things in Death are its Oblivion, Ignorance and Obscurity, whence, by <hi>Jove,</hi> it is, that almost all Mankind encounter with those that would destroy the Sense of the Departed, as placing the very whole of their Life, Being and Satisfaction solely in the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and knowing part of the Mind. For even the Things that grieve and afflict us, yet afford us a sort of Pleasure in the hearing. And it is often seen, that those that are disordered by what is told them, even to the degree of weeping, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>(g)</hi> require the telling of it. So he in the Tragedy;
<q>
                     <l>Alas! I feel't, and dread it to relate,</l>
                     <l>I dread to hear it too, but I must hav't.</l>
                  </q> But this may seem perhaps a sort of intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46331:52"/> of Delight in knowing every thing, and as it were <hi>(h)</hi> a Stream violently bearing down the reasoning Faculty. But now when a Story that hath in it nothing that's troubling and afflictive, treats of great and heroick Enterprizes with a potency and grace of Stile, Such as we find in <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s Grecian, and in <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Persian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, or in what,
<q>Inspir'd by heav'nly Gods, sage <hi>Homer</hi> sung;</q> Or in the <hi>Travels</hi> of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Republicks</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>famous Men</hi> compil'd by <hi>Aristoxenus:</hi> These will not only bring us exceeding much and great Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but such also as is clean and secure from Repentance. And who could take greater sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfacton, either in eating when a hungry, or in drinking when a-dry amongst the <hi>Phaeacks,</hi> than in going over <hi>Ʋlysses</hi>'s Relation of his own Voyage and Rambles? And what Man could be better pleas'd with the Embraces of the most exquisite beauty, than with sitting up all Night to read over what <hi>Xonophon</hi> hath wtitten of <hi>Panthea,</hi> or <hi>Aristobulus</hi> of <hi>Timoclea,</hi> or <hi>Theopompus</hi> of <hi>Thisbe?</hi> But now these appertain all solely to the Mind. But they chase away from them the Delights <hi>(i)</hi> that accrue from the Mathematicks also. Though the Satisfactions we receive from History have in them something simple and equal; but those that come from Geometry, Astronomy and Musick, inveigle and allure us with a sort of Nimbleness and Variety, and want nothing that's tempting and engaging, their Figures attracting us as so many Charms, whereof whoever hath once tasted, if he be but competently skill'd, will run about, chanting that in <hi>Sophocles,</hi>

And when King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had sent him threescore Talents for his Piece, after it was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, he neither would accept the Money, nor part with his Work. What and how great Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may we then suppose to have been reap'd from Geometry and Astronomy, by <hi>Euclid,</hi> when he wrote his Perspectives? by <hi>Philippus,</hi> when he had perfected his Demonstration of the Figure of the Moon? by <hi>Arcihmedes,</hi> when with the help of a certain Angle he had found the Sun's Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make the same part of the largest Circle, that that Angle made of four Right-ones? and by <hi>Apollonius</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> who were the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of some other Things of the like nature? The bare contemplating and comprehending of which now engender in the Learners both unspeakable Delights, and a marvellous heighth of Spirit. And it doth in no wise beseem me, by comparing with these the fulsom Debauches of Victualling Houses and Stews, to contaminate <hi>Helicon</hi> and the Muses,

Yea, we abominate those that make mention of their great Suppers with too luscious a Gust, as Men over-much taken with mean and abject Delights. But we find our selves in one and the same Extasy with <hi>Eudoxus, Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus;</hi> and readily give Assent to <hi>Plato,</hi> when he saith of the Mathematicks, <hi>That while Ignorance and Ʋnskilledness make Men despise them, they still thrive notwithstanding by reason of their Charmingness, in despite of Contempt.</hi> These then so great and so many Pleasures, and that run <hi>(r)</hi> like perpetual Springs and Rills, these Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and avoid; nor will they permit those that put in among them, so much as to take a taste of them, but bid them hoise up the little Sails of their paltry Cock-Boats, and fly from them. Nay, they all, both He and She-Philosophers, beg and entreat <hi>(s) Pythocles,</hi> for dear <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s sake, <hi>Not to affect or make such account of the Sciences called Liberal.</hi> And when they cry up and defend one <hi>Apelles,</hi> they write of him, <hi>That he kept himself clean by refraining himself all along from the Mathematicks.</hi> But as to History (to pass over their Aversedness to other kinds of Compositions) I shall only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with the Words of <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> who in his <hi>Treatise of the Poets,</hi> writes thus! <hi>Wherefore let it never disturb you, if you know not either what side</hi> Hector <hi>was of, or the first Verses in</hi> Homer<hi>'s Poem, or again,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46331:54"/> what is in its middle.</hi> But that the Pleasures of the Body spend themselves like the Winds called <hi>Etesiae,</hi> or <hi>Anniversary,</hi> and utterly determine when once Age is past it's Vigour, <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself was not insensible; and therefore he makes it a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematic Question, Whether a sage Philosopher, when he is an old Man, and disabled for Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>may not still be recreated, with having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Girls to feel and grope him?</hi> Being not, it seems, of the Mind of old <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who thank'd God he had at length escap'd from this kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as from an untame and furious Master. But in my opinion, it would be more advisable for these sensual Lechers, when they see that Age will dry up so many of their Pleasures, and that as <hi>Euripides</hi> saith,
<q>Dame <hi>Venus</hi> is to antient Men a Foe.</q> In the first place to collect and lay up in store, as against a Siege, these other Pleasures, as a sort of Provision that will not impair and decay, that then after they have celebrated the Venereal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals of Life, they may spend a cleanly After-Feast in reading over the Historians and Poets, or else in Problems of Musick and Geometry: For it would never have come into their Minds, so much as to think of these purblind and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Groopings and Spurtings of Lechery, had they but learnt, if nothing more, but to write Comments upon <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Euripides,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle, Heraclides,</hi> and <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> did. But I verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self that their neglecting to take care for such Provisions as these, and finding all the other Things they employ'd themselves in (as they use to say of Vertue) but <hi>insipid and dry,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:46331:54"/> and being wholly set upon Pleasure, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy no longer supplying them with it, gave them occasion to stoop to do Things both mean and shameful in themselves, and unbecoming their Age: as well when they refresh their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with their former Pleasures, and serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of old ones, as it were long since dead, and laid up in Pickle for the purpose, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have fresh ones; as when again they offer violence to Nature, by suscitating and chafing in their decay'd Bodys, as in cold Embers <hi>(u)</hi> other new ones equally sensless, they having not, it seems, their Minds stor'd with any congenial Pleasure, or that is <hi>(w)</hi> worth the rejoycing at. As to the other Delights of the Mind, we have already treated of them, as they occurred to us. But their Adversness and Dislike to Musick, that affords us so great Delights, and such charming Satisfactions, a Man could not forget that would, by reason of the inconsistency of what <hi>Epicurus</hi> saith, when he pronounceth in his Book called his <hi>Doubts,</hi> his wise Man ought to be a Lover of publick Spectacles, and to delight <hi>(x)</hi> above any other Man, in the Musick and Shews of the <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals;</hi> and yet he will not admit of Musick-Problems, or of the Critical Enquiries of Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists, no, not so much as at a Compotation. Yea, he advises such Princes as are Lovers of the Muses, <hi>rather to entertain themselves at their Feasts, with either some Narration of Military Adventures, or with the importune Sourilities of Drolls and Buffoons, than to engage in Disputes about Musick, or in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of Poetry:</hi> For this very thing he had the Face to write in his <hi>Treatise of Monarchy,</hi> as if he were writing to <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> or to <hi>Naratus</hi> Basha of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For neither would a <hi>Hieron,</hi> or an

And indeed what do they ever embrace or affect, that's either genteel or regardable, when it hath nothing of Pleasure to accompany it? and would it not far less affect a pleasurable way of living, to be, like Beetles and Vulturs, disgusted with Perfumes and Odours, than to shun and abhor the Conversation of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Criticks and Musicians? For what Flute or Harp ready tun'd for a Lesson, or,

As for Instance, Why the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of two Flutes of the same Longitude should speak flatter? Why, if you raise the Flute, all its Notes will be sharp; and flat again, if you stoop it? And why, when clapt to another, <hi>(b)</hi> it will sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d flatter; and sharper again, when taken from it? Why also, if you scatter Chaff or Dust about the <hi>Orchestra,</hi> or <hi>Dancing-Place</hi> of a Theater, the Spectators Eyes will be blinded? And why, when one would have set up a Copper <hi>Alexander</hi> for a Frontispiece to a Stage at <hi>Pella,</hi> the Architect ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to the contrary, because it would spoil the Actors Voices? And why, of the several kinds of Musick, the <hi>Chromatick</hi> will diffuse, and the <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> compose the Mind? But now the several Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Poets, their differing Turns and Forms of Stile, and the Solutions of their difficult Places, have conjoin'd with a sort of Dignity and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, somewhat also that's extreme agreeable and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46331:56"/> charming, insomuch that to me they seem to do what was once said by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> to make a Man even to forget the Joys of Love, so powerful and overcoming is the Pleasure they bring us, of which these Gentlemen have not the least share, nor do they so much as pretend or desire to have any. But while they are sinking and depressing their contemplative Part into the Body, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it down by their sensual and intemperate Appetites, as by so many Weights of Lead, they make themselves appear little better than Hostlers or Graizers, that still ply their Cattle with Hay, Straw, or Grass, looking upon such Provender as the properest and meetest Food for them: And is it not e'en thus they would swill the Mind with the Pleasures of the Body, as Hogherds do their Swine, while they will not allow it can be gay any longer <hi>(c)</hi> than it is hoping, sensing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring something that refers to the Body, but will not have it either to receive or seek for any congenial Joy or Satisfaction from within it self? Though what can be more absurd and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, than when there are two things that go to make up the Man, a Body and a Soul, and the Soul besides hath the Prerogative of governing, that the Body should have its peculiar, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and proper Good, and the Soul none at all, but must sit gazing at the Body, and simper at it's Passious, as if she were pleas'd and affected with them, though indeed she be all the while wholly untouch'd and unconcern'd, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her own to chuse, desire, or take delight in? For they should either pull off the Vizor quite, and say plainly, <hi>That Man is all Body</hi> (as some of them do, that take away all Mental Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) or if they will allow us to have two distinct
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46331:56"/> Natures, they should then leave to each its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Good and Evil, agreeable and disagreeable; as we find it to be with our Senses, each of which is peculiarly adapted to its own Sensible, though they all very strangely intercommune one with another. Now the Intellect is the proper Sense of the Mind, and therefore that it should have no congenial Speculation, Movement, or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its own, the attaining to which should be matter of Complacency to it, is the most irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal thing in the World; I have not, by <hi>Jove,</hi> unwittingly done the Men wrong, and been my self impos'd upon by some that may perhaps have caluminated them. Then I said to him, If we may be your Judges, you have not; yea, we must acquit you from having offer'd them the least indignity; and therefore pray dispatch the rest of your Discourse with Assurance. How! said I, and shall not <hi>Aristodemus</hi> then suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed me, if you are tir'd out your self? <hi>Aristode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> said, with all my Heart, when you are as much tir'd as he is; but since you are yet in your vigour, pray make use of your self, my noble Friend, and don't think to pretend weariness. <hi>Theon</hi> then replied, what is yet behind, I must confess, is very easy; it being but to go over the several Pleasures contained in that part of Life that consists in Action. Now themselves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where say, <hi>That there is far more Satifaction in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in receiving Good;</hi> and good may be done many times, it's true, by Words, but the most and greatest part of Good, consists in Action, as the very name of Benificence tells us, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also attest. For you may remember, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, we heard this Gentleman tell us <hi>(d)</hi> but now, what words <hi>Epicurus</hi> utter'd, and what
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46331:57"/> Letters he sent to his Friends, applauding and magnifying <hi>Metrodorus, how bravely, and like a Spark (e)</hi> he quitted the City, and went down to the Port <hi>Pireaeum,</hi> to relieve <hi>Mithres</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and this, though <hi>Metrodorus</hi> did not then do any thing at all. What and how great then may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume the Pleasures of <hi>Plato</hi> to have been <hi>(f)</hi> when <hi>Dion</hi> by the measures he gave him, Deposed the Tyrant <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and set <hi>Sicily</hi> at Liberty? And what the Pleasures of <hi>Aristotle</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built his Native City <hi>Stagira,</hi> then levell'd with the ground, and brought back its exil'd Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants? And what the Pleasures of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and of <hi>Phidias,</hi> when they cut off the Tyrants of their respective Countreys? For what need a Man recount to you, who so well know it, how many particular Persons they reliev'd, not <hi>by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a little Wheat, or a measure of Meal</hi> (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did to some of his Friends) but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Restoration to the Banish'd, Liberty to the Imprison'd, and Restitution of Wives and Children to those that had been bereft of them? But a Man could not that would pass by the sottish stupidity of the Man, that though he tramples under Foot, and Villifies the great and generous Actions of <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Miltiades,</hi> yet writes these very words to his Friends about him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>(g) You have given a very gallant and noble Testimony of your care of me, in the provision of Corn you have made for me, and have declar'd your Affection to me by Signs that mount to the very Skies.</hi> So that should a Man but take that poor parcel of Corn out of the great Philosopers Epistle, it might seem to be the recital of some Letter of Thanks for the Delivery or Preservation of all <hi>Greece,</hi> or of the Commons of <hi>Athens:</hi> We will now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46331:57"/> to mention that Nature requires very large and chargeable Provisions to be made for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of the Pleasures of the Body; nor can the heighth of Delicacy be had in Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menty and Lentile Pottage, but Voluptuous and Sensual Appetites expect costly Dishes, <hi>Thasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Wines, Perfumed Unguents, and Varieties of Pastry Works,
<q>
                     <l>And Cakes by Female Hands wrought artfully,</l>
                     <l>Well steep'd i'th Liquor of the Gold-wing'd Bee.</l>
                  </q> And besides all this, handsome young Lasses too; <hi>(h)</hi> Such as <hi>Leontion, Boidion, Hedeia</hi> and <hi>Nikidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that were wont to rome about in <hi>(i) Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s Philosophick Garden. But now such Joys as suit the Mind must undoubtedly be grounded upon a Grandeur of Actions, and a Splendor of worthy Deeds, if Men would not seem little, ungenerous and puerile, but on the contrary, bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, firm and brave. But for a Man to be Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>(k)</hi> for his sweet and pretty Humor, like <hi>Tarpaulins</hi> upon the Festivals of <hi>Venus,</hi> and to vaunt himself for that when he was sick of an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> he notwithstanding called his Friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to certain Collations, and grudged not his Dropsie the Satisfaction of good Liquors, and because when he called to remembrance the last Words of <hi>Neocles,</hi> he was melted with a peculiar sort of Joy, intermixt with Tears, no Man in his right Senses would call these true Joys or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. Nay, I will be bold to say, that if such a thing as <hi>(l)</hi> that they call a <hi>Sardinian</hi> or <hi>grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Laughter,</hi> can happen to the Mind; it is to be found in these forcings and crying Laughters. But if any will needs have them still call'd by the

                  <l>As he passes through the Throngs i'th City,</l>

               </q>
               <p>For he that can so affect and move other Men, as to fill them with Joy and Rapture, and to make them long to touch him and salute him, cannot but appear even to a blind Man to possess and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy very extraordinary Satisfactions in himself: And hence it comes that such Men are both inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable and undaunted in serving the Publick; and we still hear some such Words from them,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>(w)</hi> Thy Father got Thee for the Common Good; <hi>And,</hi>

                     <l>Let's not give off to benefit Mankind.</l>
                  </q> But what need I instance in those that are consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately good? For, if to one of the midling Rank of bad Men, when he is just a dying, he that hath the Power over him; whether his God or Prince, should but allow him one Hour more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46331:59"/> condition, that after he hath spent that either in some Generous Action or sensual Enjoyment, he should then presently Dye, who would in this time chuse rather to accompany with <hi>Lais,</hi> or drink Wine from Cape <hi>Ariusion,</hi> than dispatch <hi>Archias,</hi> and restore the <hi>Athenians</hi> to their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? For my part, I believe none would: For I see that even common Sword-players, if they are not utter Brutes and Savages, but <hi>Greek</hi> born, when they are to enter the List, though there be many and very costly Dishes set before them; yet take more Content in employing their Time in commending their poor Wives to some of their Friends, <hi>(x)</hi> yea, and in conferring Freedom on their Slaves, than in gratifying their Stomachs. <hi>(y)</hi> But should the Pleasures of the Body be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have some extraordinary matter in them, this would yet be common <hi>(z)</hi> to Men of Action and Business.</p>
               <q>For they can eat good Meat, and red Wine drink;</q>
               <p>Ay, and entertain themselves with their Friends, and perhaps with a greater Relish too, after their Engagements and hard Services, as did <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and by <hi>Jove, Phocion</hi> and <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> too, than these Gentlemen who anoint themselves by the Fire-side, and are gingerly rock't about the Streets in Sedans: yea, those make but small account of such Pleasures as these, as being comprised in those greater ones. For what should a Man mention <hi>Epaminondas</hi>'s denying to Sup with one when he saw the Preparations made, were above the Man's Estate, but frankly told his Friend, <hi>I thought you had intended a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and not a Debauch,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> himself refused Queen <hi>Ada</hi>'s Cooks, telling her, <hi>He had
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46331:60"/> better ones of his own, to wit, Travelling by Night for his Dinner, and a light Dinner for his Supper;</hi> and when <hi>Philoxenus</hi> writing to him about some hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Boys, and desiring to know of him whether he would have him buy them for him, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a small matter of being discharged his Office for it: and yet who might better have them than he? But as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saith, <hi>That of two Pains the lesser is observed by the greater;</hi> so the Pleasures that accrue from Action, and the Love of Glory while they chear and refresh the Mind, do by their Transcendency and Grandeur, obliterate and extinguish the Inferiour Satisfactions of the Body. If then the remembring of former good things (as they affirm) be that which most contributes to a pleasurable Living, not one of us will then credit <hi>Epicurus,</hi> when he tells us, <hi>That while he was dying away, in the midst of the strongest Agonies and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, he yet bore himself up with the Memory of the Pleasures he formerly enjoyed.</hi> For a Man may better see the Resemblance of his own Face in a troubled Deep or a Storm, than a smooth and smiling Remembrance of past Pleasure in a Body tortured with such lancing and rending Pains. But now the Memories of past Actions no Man can put from him that would. For, did <hi>Alexander,</hi> think you (or indeed how could he possibly) forget the Fight at <hi>Arbela?</hi> or <hi>Pelopidas</hi> the Tyrant <hi>Leontiadas?</hi> Or <hi>Themistocles,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement at <hi>Salamis?</hi> For the <hi>Athenians</hi> to this very Day keep an Annual Festival for <hi>(a)</hi> the Battle at <hi>Marathon;</hi> and the <hi>Thebans</hi> for that at <hi>Leuctra;</hi> and so, by <hi>Jove,</hi> do we our selves (as you very well know) for that which <hi>Diophantus</hi> gained at <hi>Hyampolis,</hi> and all <hi>Phocis</hi> is filled with Sacrifices and publick Honours: Nor is there any
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46331:60"/> of us that is better satisfied with what himself hath either eaten or drunk, than he is with what they have atchieved. <hi>(b)</hi> It is very easie then to imagine what great Content, Satisfaction and Joy, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Authors of these Actions in their Life-time; when the very Memory of them hath not yet, after five hundred Years and more, lost its rejoycing Power. The truth is, <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself allows there are some Pleasures derived from Fame: And indeed why should he not, when himself had such a furious Lechery and Rigling after Glory; as made him not only to disown his Masters, and scuffle about Syllables and Accents <hi>(c)</hi> with his Fellow Pedant <hi>Democrates</hi> (whose Grammar Rules he stole <hi>verbatim</hi>) and to tell his Disciples <hi>there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a Wise Man in the World besides himself;</hi> but also to put it in Writing, how Colotes <hi>performed Adoration to him, as he was one day Philosophizing, by touching his Knees;</hi> And that his own Brother <hi>Neocles</hi> was used from a Child to say, <hi>There nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor ever was in the World, a wiser Man than</hi> Epicurus: But you must know his Mother had just so many Atoms within her, as when they came together, produced a compleat Wise Man. May not a Man then, as <hi>Callicratides</hi> once said of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Admiral <hi>Conon, That he Whor'd the Sea,</hi> as well say of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that he basely and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly forces and ravishes Fame, by not enjoying her publickly, but ruffling and debauching her in a Corner? For as Men's Bodies are oft necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Famine, for want of other Food, to prey, against Nature, upon themselves; a like Mischief to this Vain-glory creates in Men's Minds, it forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, when they hunger after Praise, and cannot obtain it from other Men, at last to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselves. And do not they then that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46331:61"/> stand so well affected towards Applause and Fame themselves, own they cast away very extraordinary Pleasures, when they decline Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strature, Publick Offices, and the Favour and Confidence of Princes, from whom <hi>Democritus</hi> once said, the grandest Blessings of Humane Life are derived? For he will never induce any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to believe, that he that could so highly value and please himself with the Attestation of his Brother <hi>Neocles,</hi> and the Adoration of his Friend <hi>Colotes,</hi> would not, were he clapt by all the <hi>Greeks</hi> at the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> go quite out of his Wits, and even hollow for Joy; or, rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be elated in the manner spoken of by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles;</hi>
                  <q>Puft like the Down of a gray-headed Thistle.</q> If it be a pleasing thing then to be of a good Fame; and on the contrary afflictive, to be of an ill one. It is most certain, that nothing in the World can be more infamous than <hi>Want of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Idleness, Atheism, Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Negligence.</hi> Now these are looked upon by all Men, except themselves, as the inseparable Companions of their Party. But unjustly may some one say: Be it so then; for we consider not now the Truth of the Charge, but what Fame and Reputation they are of in the World: And we shall forbear at present to mention the many Books that have been writen to defame them, <hi>(d)</hi> and the blackning Decrees made against them by several Republicks, for that would look like Bitterness. But if the Answers of Oracles, the Providence of the Gods, and the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Affection of Parents to their Issue; if Civil Policy, Military Order, and the Office of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46331:61"/> Magistracy, be things to be looked upon as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly esteemed and celebrated; it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity then be allowed also, That they that tell us, <hi>It is none of their Business to preserve the</hi> Greeks, <hi>but to Eat and Drink, so as not to offend, but pleasure their Stomachs,</hi> are base and ignominious Persons; and that their being reputed such, must needs extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble them, and make their Lives untoward to them, if they take Honour and a Good Name for any part of their Satisfaction. When <hi>Thenon</hi> had thus spoken, we thought good to break up our Walk to rest us a while (as we were wont to do) upon the Benches: Nor did we continue any long space in our Silence at what was spoken; for <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> taking his Hint from what had been said, spake to us, Who will make up that of the Discourse which is yet behind? for it hath not yet received its due Conclusion; and this Gentleman, by mentiong Divination and Providence, did, in my Opinion, suggest as much to us: for these People boast that these very things do not the least contribute to the providing of their Lives with Pleasure, Serenity and Assurance; so that there must be something said to these two. <hi>Aristodemus</hi> subjoyned then and said: As to Pleasure, I think there hath been enough said already to evince that, supposing their Doctrine successful, and to attain its own Design, it yet doth but ease us of Fear, and a certain Superstitious Perswasion, but helps us not to any Comfort or Joy from the Gods at all; nay, while it brings us to such a State, as to be neither disquieted, nor pleased with them, it doth but render us in the same manner affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as we are towards the Fish in the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Sea, from which we expect neither good nor harm.

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:46331:63"/> added to what hath been already spoken, I think I may very well take it from themselves; and in the first place, whereas they quarrel extreamly with those that would take away all Sorrowing, Weeping and Sighing for the Deaths of Friends, and tell them that such Unconcernedness as arrives to an Insensibility, proceeds from some other worse Cause, to wit, <hi>Inhumanity, excessive Vain-glory,</hi> or <hi>prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fierceness;</hi> and that therefore it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a little concerned and affected; yea, <hi>(e)</hi> and to <hi>liquor ones Eyes,</hi> and <hi>be melted,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretty things of the like kind, which they use foppishly to affect and counterfeit, that they may be thought tender and loving-hearted People. For just in this manner <hi>Epicurus</hi> exprest himself upon the Occasion of the Death of <hi>(f) Hegesianax,</hi> when he wrote to <hi>Dositheus</hi> the Father, and to <hi>Pyrson</hi> the Brother of the deceased Person; for I fortuned ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately to run over his Epistles. And I say, in imitation of them, that <hi>Atheism</hi> is no less an Evil than <hi>Inhumanity</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> into which they would lead us, who take away with God's Anger, the Comfort we might derive from him. For it would be much better for us to have something of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiting Passion of Dauntedness and Fear conjoyned and intermixt with our Sentiments of a Deity, than while we fly from it, to leave our selves neither Hope, Content, nor Assurance in the Enjoyment of our Good Things; nor any recourse to God in our Adversity and Misfortunes. We ought it is True, to remove Superstition from the Perswasion we have of the Gods, as we would the Gum from our Eyes; but if that be impossible, we must not root out and extinguish with it, the Belief which the most have of the Gods; nor is that a dismaying and sower one neither, as these Gentlemen feign,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46331:63"/> while they libel and abuse the Blessed Providence, representing her as the Hag that rides Children; or, as some Fell and Tragick Fury: Yea, I must tell you, there are some in the World that fear God in an Excess, for whom yet it would not be better not so to fear him. For while they dread him as a Governor, that is gentle to the Good, and severe to the Bad, and are by this one Fear, which makes them not to need many others, <hi>(g)</hi> freed from doing ill, and brought to keep their Wickedness with them in quiet; and as it were in an enfeebled Languor, they come hereby to have less Disquiet than those that indulge the Practice of it, and are rash and daring in it; and then presently after fear and repent of it. Now that Disposition of Mind which the greater and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant part of Mankind, that are not utterly bad, are of towards God, hath its very true, conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Regard and Honour they pay him, a kind of Anguish and astonished Dread, which is also called Superstition; but, notwithstanding this, the good Hope and gay Hilarity that attends it, is ten thousand times <hi>(h)</hi> more and greater than it, while it both implores and receives the whole Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Prosperity and good Success from the Gods only. And this is manifest by the greatest Tokens that can be; for neither do the Discourses of those that wait at the Temples, nor the good times of our Solemn Festivals, nor any other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Actions or Sights, more recreate and delight us then what we see and do about the Gods our selves, while we assist at the publick Ceremonies, and joyn in the Sacred Balls, and attend at the Sacrifices and Initiations. For the Mind is not then sorrowful, demiss and heavy, as if she were addressing to certain Tyrants or cruel Torturers,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46331:64"/> as otherwise she would be; but on the contrary, where she is most apprehensive and fulliest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Divinity is present, there she most of all throws off Sorrows, Tears and Pensiveness, and lets her self loose to what is pleasing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, to the very degree of Tipsiness, Frolick and Laughter; in amorous Concerns, as the Poet said once,
<q>
                     <l>When Old Man and Old Wife think of Loves Fires,</l>

<q>The dusty thick Leg'd Drab that turns the Mill;</q> And Houshold Slaves and Day-Laborers are strangely elevated and transported with Mirth and Jovialty. Rich Men as well as Princes are used at certain times to make publick Entertainments, and to keep Open Houses: But the Feasts they make at the Solemnities and Sacrifices, when they now apprehend their Minds to approach nearest the Divinity, have conjoined with the Honour and Veneration they pay him, a much more trascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pleasure and Satisfaction. Of this, he that hath renounced Gods Providence hath not the least Share; for what recreates and chears us at the Festivals, is not the store of good Wine and Roast-meat, but the good Hope and Perswasion that God is there present and propitious to us, and kindly accepts of what we do. From some of our Festivals we exclude the Flute and Garland; but if God be not present at the Sacrifice, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity

<q>No Man can Love what he is made to do.</q> For which very reason they think the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are not pleased in their Minds; but in Fear, while they attend at the Sacrifices and Mysteries; though they themselves are in no better Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they do the same things out of Fear, and partake not neither of the great good Hope as the others do; but are only fearful and uneasie, lest they should come to be discovered, and therefore cheat and abuse the Publick, upon whose account it is that they compose the Books they write about the Gods and the Divine Nature,
<q>

And now after the two former Ranks of ill and common Men; we will in the third place consider <hi>(k)</hi> the best sort, and most beloved of the Gods, and what great Satisfaction they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from their <hi>(l)</hi> clean and generous Sentiments of the Deity, to wit, That he is the Prince of all good things, and the Parent of all things brave; and can no more do an unworthy thing, than he can be made to suffer it: For he is Good, and he that is Good, can upon no account fall into Envy, Fear, Anger, or Hatred; for neither is it proper to a hot thing to cool, but to heat; nor to a good thing to do harm. Now Anger is by Nature at the farthest distance imaginable from Conplacency, and Spleenishness from Placidness, and Animosity and Turbulence from Humanity and Kindness. For the latter of these proceed from Generosity and Fortitude, but the former from Impotency and Baseness. <hi>(m)</hi> The Deity is not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by their Angers or Kindnesses; but that is, because it is natural to it to be Kind and Aiding, and unnatural to be Angry and Hurtful.

Dost thou fancy something better after this Life, than what thou hast here? Thou dost but deceive thy self</hi> (y) <hi>for what is dissolved hath no sense; and that which hath no sense, is nothing to us.</hi> Ay, but how comes it then, my good Friend, that you bid me eat and be merry?

<q>If ne'r more seen without the hoary Main.</q> Yea, she presently evaporates, disperses, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, even before the Body it self; so that it seems her great and excessive rejoicing, must be only for having learn'd this one Sage and Divine Maxim, That all her Misfortunes will at last determine in her own Destruction, Dissolution and Annihilation. But (said he, looking upon me,) I should be impertinent, should I say any thing upon this Subject <hi>(z)</hi> when we have heard you but now discourse so fully against those that would perswade us that <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Doctrine about the Soul, renders Men more dispos'd and better pleased to Die, than <hi>Plato</hi>'s doth. <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subjoyn'd and said; And must our present Debate be left then unfinisht, because of that? or shall we be afraid to oppose that Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to <hi>Epicurus?</hi> No, by no means, I said; and <hi>Empedocles</hi> tells us that,
<q>What's very good, claims to be heard twice.</q> Therefore we must apply our selves again to them; for I think he was not present at our former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; but if he was, he is a young-Man, and needs not fear being charg'd by these young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, for having a bad Memory. Then <hi>Theon,</hi> like one constrain'd, said; Well then, if you
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46331:67"/> will needs have me to go on with the Discourse, I will not do as you did, <hi>Aristodemus:</hi> for you were shy of repeating what this Gentleman spoke, but I shall not scruple to make use of what you have said; for I think indeed you did very well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Mankind into three ranks; the first of wicked and very bad Men, the second of the Vulgar and common sort and the third of Good and Wise Men: the Wicked and bad sort then, while they dread any kind of Divine Vengeance and Punishment at all, and are by this deterr'd from doing Mischief, and thereby enjoy the greater Quiet, will live both in more Pleasure, and less Disturbance for it. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> is of opinion, That <hi>the only proper Means to keep Men from doing ill, is the fear of Punishments.</hi> So that we should cram them with more and more Superstition still, and raise up against them both from Heaven and Earth, Terrors, Chasms, Frights and Surmises, if their being amazed with such things as these, will make them become the more tame and gentle. For it is more for their benefit to be restrained from Criminal Actions by the Fears of what comes after Death, than to commit them, and then to live in perpetual Danger and Fear. As to the Vulgar sort, besides their fear of what's in Hell, the hope they have conceiv'd of an Eternity from the Tales and Fictions of the Ancients, and their great desire of Being, which is both the prime and strongest of all others, exceeds in Pleasure and sweet Content of Mind, that Childish dread. <hi>(a)</hi> And therefore when they loose their Children, Wives or Friends, they had rather have them be somewhere, and remain still, tho in Misery, than they should be quite destroy'd, dissolv'd, and reduc'd to nothing: And they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46331:67"/> are pleased, when they hear it said of a Dying Person, that he <hi>goes away,</hi> or <hi>departs,</hi> and such other words as intimate Death to be the Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and and not Destruction. And they sometimes speak thus,
<q>But I'le ev'n there think on my dearst Friend.</q> And thus,
<q>
                     <l>What's your command to <hi>Hector,</hi> let me know,</l>
                     <l>And to your dear old <hi>Priam,</hi> e're I go.</l>
                  </q> And (there arising hereupon an erroneous devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) they are the better pleased when they bury with their Departed Friends, such Arms, Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Cloaths, as were most familiar to them in their Life-time, <hi>(b)</hi> as <hi>Minos</hi> did the <hi>Cretan</hi> Flutes with <hi>Glaucus,</hi>
                  <q>Made of the Shanks ef a dead Brindled Fawn.</q> And if they do but imagine they either ask or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing of them, they are glad when they give it them. Thus <hi>Periander</hi> burnt his Queens Attire with her, because he thought she had ask'd for it, and complain'd she was a cold. <hi>(c)</hi> Nor doth an <hi>Aeacus,</hi> an <hi>Ascalaphus,</hi> or an <hi>Acheron</hi> much disorder them, whom they have often gratified with Balls, Shews and Musick <hi>(d)</hi> of every sort. But now all Men shrink at such a face of Death, as dismal, grim and dark, as carrys with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility, oblivion and extinction of Knowledg: And they are discomposed, when they hear it said of any one <hi>he is perisht,</hi> or <hi>is gone,</hi> or <hi>he is no more;</hi> and they shew great uneasiness when they hear such words as these:

For Insensibility, Dissolution, and the conceit, that <hi>what hath no sense, is nothing to us,</hi> doth not at all abate the fear of Death, but rather helps to confirm it: for this very thing is it that Nature most dreaded:
<q>But may you all return to Mould and Wet;</q> To wit, The Dissolution of the Soul into what is without knowledge or sense, which while <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> would have to be a separtion into Atomes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46331:68"/> and Void, he doth but further cut off all hope of Immortality; to compass which I can scarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from saying, That all, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would be well contented to be worried by <hi>Cerberus</hi> and to carry Water into <hi>(i)</hi> the Tub full of holes, so they might but continue in being, and not be exterminated. Though (as I said before) there are not very many that stand in fear of these things, they being but the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Old Women, and the fabular Stories of Mothers and Nurses; and even they that do fear them, yet believe that certain Rites of Initiation and Purgation will relieve them, by which when they are cleansed, <hi>(k)</hi> they shall Play and Dance in Hell for ever, in company with those that have the priviledg of a bright Light, clear Air, and the use of Speech; but now to be depriv'd of Living, disturbs all both Young and Old. For,
<q>
                     <l>(l) W' appear impatient Lovers of this Light,</l>
                     <l>When it shines under ground, and's out of Sight;</l>

               </q>
               <p>And therefore it is very plain, that with the Belief of Immortality, they take away the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and greatest hopes the vulgar sort have.

Thus I account Death a truly great and accomplisht good thing; the Soul being to live there a real Life, which here lives not a waking Life, but suffers things most resembling Dreams. If then (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> saith) <hi>the remembrance of a dead friend be a thing every way complacent;</hi> we may easily from thence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how great a Joy they deprive themselves of, that think they do but embrace and pursue the Phantoms and Shades of their deceased Familiars, that have in them neither Knowledg nor Sense; but never expect to be with them again, nor to see their dear Father, and dear Mother, and sweet Wife; nor have any hopes of that familiarity
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46331:69"/> and dear Converse they have, that think of the Soul with <hi>Pythagoras, Plato</hi> and <hi>Homer:</hi> Now, what their sort of Passion is like to, was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by <hi>Homer,</hi> when he threw into the midst of the Soldiers, as they were engag'd, the shade of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> as if he had been Dead; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again presented his Friends with him himself,
<q>Coming alive and well, as brisk as ever.</q> At which he saith,
<q>
                     <l>They all were over-joy'd, and left the shade,</l>
                     <l>And him embrac't himself,—</l>
                  </q> And should not we then, when Reason shews us that a real converse with Persons departed this Life may be had; and that he that loves, may both feel and be with the Party that affects and loves him; relinquish these Men that cannot so much as cast off all those airy Shades, and out-side Barks, for which they are all their time in lamentation and fresh afflictions. Moreover, they that look upon Death as the commencement of another and better Life, if they enjoy good things, <hi>(o)</hi> are the better pleased with them, as expecting much greater hereafter; but if they have not things here to their Minds, they do not much grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it; but the hopes of those good and excellent things that are after Death, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them such ineffable Pleasures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectances, wipe off and wholly obliterate every defect, and every offence from the Mind, which as on a Road, or rather indeed in a short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation out of the Road, bears whatever befals
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46331:70"/> it with great ease and mediocrity. But now, as to those to whom Life ends in Insensibility and Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Death bringing not to them a removal of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, though it be afflicting in both conditions, yet is it more so to those that live Prosperously, than to such as undergo Adversity: For it cuts the latter but from an uncertain hope of doing better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but it deprives the former of a certain good, to wit, their pleasurable living. And as those Medicinal Potions that are not grateful to the Palate, but yet necessary, give sick Men ease, but rake and hurt the well, just so (in my opinion) doth the Philosophy of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> while it promises to those that live miserably a Death not happy; and <hi>(p)</hi> to those that do well, an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extinction and dissolution of the Mind, but quite obstructs the Comfort and Solace of the grave and wise, that abound with good things, by throwing them down from a happy living in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deprivation of both Life and Being. From hence then it is manifest, that the Contemplation of the loss of good things will afflict us in as great a measure, as either the firm hopes or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent enjoyments of them recreate us. Yea, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves tell us, <hi>That their being freed from the fond sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of incessant and endless Evils, leaves them the most assur'd and complacent Good,</hi> to wit, <hi>the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Delivery; and that</hi> Epicurus's <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine effects this, by stopping the fear of Death in the Souls dissolution.</hi> If then deliverance from the expectation of infinite Evils, be a matter of great complacence; how comes it not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive to be bereft of eternal good things, and to miss of the highest and most consummate Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city? For, not to be, can be good for neither condition; but is on the contrary both against
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46331:70"/> Nature, and ungrateful to all that have a Being. But those it eases of the Evils of Life, have, it's very true, the want of sense to comfort them for the Evil of Death <hi>(q)</hi> while they as it were make their escape from Life. But on the other hand, they that change from good things to nothing, seem to me to have the most dismaying end of all, it putting a Period to their Happiness. For Nature doth not fear Insensibility, as the entrance upon some new thing, but because it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our present good things; for though the destruction of all we can call ours, be in the accomplishment nothing to us, yet is it still some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us in the thoughts of it. And Insensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity afflicts not those that are not, when they are not, but those that are, when they think what damage they shall sustain by it, in the loss of their Beings, and in being not suffered so much as to descend to Hell. Wherefore it is <hi>(r)</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Dog <hi>Cerberus,</hi> nor the River <hi>Cokytus,</hi> that hath made our fear os Death endless; but the threatned danger of not being, representing it as impossible for such as are once extinct to shift back again into Being. <hi>For we cannot be Born twice; and our not being must last for ever,</hi> as <hi>Epicurus</hi> speaks. For if our end be in not being, and that be infinite and unalterable, then hath privation of Good found out an Eternal Evil, to wit, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ending insensibleness. <hi>Herodotus</hi> was much wiser, when he said that <hi>(s) Gods having tasted the sweet of Eternity, occasions him to demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self enviously in it, and especially to those that conceit themselves happy, to whom pleasure is but a bait for sorrow, they being but permitted to taste of what they must be depriv'd of.</hi> For what solace, or fruition, or exultation would not the perpetually injected
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46331:71"/> Thought of the Souls being disperst into <hi>Infinity,</hi> as into a certain huge and vast Ocean, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and quell in those that found their amiable Good and Beatitude in Pleasure? But, and if it be true (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> thinks it is) that most Men die in very acute pain, then is the fear of Death in all respects inconsolable; it bringing us through Evils unto a Deprivation of Good. And yet they are never wearied with their brawling and dunning of all Persons to take the escape of Evil for Good, and no longer to repute privation of Good for an Evil; though yet they still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess what we have asserted, that Death hath in it nothing of either good Hope or Solace; but that all that's complacent and good is then whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguisht: at which time those Men look for many amiable, great and divine things, that conceive the Minds of Men to be unperishable and immortal, or at least <hi>(t)</hi> to go about in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain long Revolutions of times, being one while upon Earth, and another while in Heaven, until they are at last <hi>(u)</hi> dissolv'd with the Universe, and then, together with the Sun and Moon, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd into an Intellective Fire. So large a Field, and of so great Pleasures, <hi>Epicurus</hi> wholly cuts off, when he destroys (as hath been said) the Hopes and Graces we should derive from the Gods, and by that extinguishes, both in our Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive capacity, the desire of Knowledge, and in our Active, the love of Glory; and confines and abases our Nature to a Poor narrrow thing, and that not cleanly neither, to wit, the content the Mind receives by the Body; as if it were capable of no higher Good, than the escape of Evil.</p>

His Father <hi>Neocles</hi> was (as <hi>Strabo</hi> informs us) one of the two Thousand Poor that were sent out by the Republick to plant in <hi>Sames.</hi> Where, after some small acquaintance with the <hi>Pyrrhonian Nausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> he began to play the Philosopher himself at his Parents House, where to help to maintain them he kept a Grammar School. <hi>Quum agellus eum non aleret, ut opinor, ludimagister fuit,</hi> saith <hi>Cicero.</hi> From thence he removed to <hi>Mytilene</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where he set up a second time for both School-Master and Philosopher; and from thence he went to that fam'd Oracle of <hi>Priapus, Lampsacus,</hi> where he had all his chief Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>i. e. Metrodorus, Timocrates, Polytenus,</hi> and his dear <hi>Colotkin;</hi> called by <hi>Plutarch</hi> elsewhere, <hi>the young Gentlemen of</hi> Lampsacus: And in fine, he returned home to <hi>Athens,</hi> where after a short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Platonist <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whom he quickly learnt to despise, he set up an Academy of his own in his Garden.</p>

                     <hi>(u Dissolved with the Ʋniverse.]</hi> The Pagan Opinion of an Universal Conflagration is not (as the <hi>Jewish</hi> is) from Divine Revelation, nor yet (as some very good Men piously believe) from I know not what <hi>Cabala,</hi> or <hi>unfailing Tradition.</hi> But as it was both extream ancient and general, and that as well in <hi>Greece, Germany</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> as in <hi>Aegypt, India</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> so it must have some equally prevailing reasons to support it. First then when Men came to consider the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateness of the Planetary Revolutions, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Sun and Moon; and saw that what the Moon did in the Compass of one Month, was perform'd by the Sun in Twelve, it was but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for them to suspect (as Man's ingeny is naturally curious and prying) that there might be some other larger Year, that might comprise many of ours; and be to the Universe, what ours is to the Earth only; which after they had once admitted, they seem to have inferr'd next, that those two extreams of that great Year, that should answer to our Summers and Winters, could prove no less then universal Conflagrations and Deluges. And they were without doubt very much fortified in this Opinion, as well by Earthquakes, Storms, Inundations, and Eruptions of Fire out of the Earth, as by the frequent Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, which to ignorant People that knew not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46331:87"/> the real causes of them, might very well seem to presaage the Dissolution and Ruine of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. Agreeable to this we find in the above-mentioned <hi>Snorro Turleson,</hi> that the Pagan <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Teutons</hi> held there were two Wolves that were in constant pursuit of the Sun and Moon; and that now and then they had a snatch at them, which occasion'd the Eclipses: But that at last, at the great <hi>Ragnarock,</hi> or <hi>Twi-light of the Gods</hi> (as they call'd it) they should finally overtake and devour them. At which time <hi>Surt,</hi> which is the <hi>Black-Man</hi> that keeps Centinel at the Worlds end with a bright Sword in his hand, shall fire Heaven and Earth with the Flames of <hi>Muspelheim</hi> (so they call the Southern or hot-side of Hell) and then the Gods shall all die, and the whole World fall in pieces: After which the Universe will be again renew'd, and the Sons of the old Gods shall supply their vacant places. And if the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prophets in their Sacred Annals mentioned several Conflagrations and Deluges, that ought not at all to move us, it being most apparent by several good Tokens, (such as their men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Suns rising four times in the West, and setting in the East (as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who was himself among them relates to us) and their ridiculous and feign'd Successions of Monarchs and Dynasties,) that in compiling those Annals they consulted not the Truth but the Gust and Humour of the Vulgar. For the Policy of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest-hood lay not in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Knowledge among the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nor in making them one jot wiser or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester than Nature left them; but on the contrary, in improving and inflaming their Prepossessions and Mistakes, the better to govern
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46331:87"/> and manage them, and to this end they culled out the quaintest and most influencing of their old Tales and Fictions, and drest them up in the form of a History; and then by common consent, stampt upon them the uncontestable Authority of their God <hi>Hermes.</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it not for one of these reasons; amongst Elements and Principles, one is Masculine and the other Faeminine; One <hi>[i. e. Fire]</hi> hath in it the Principles of motion, the other <hi>[i. e. Water]</hi> hath the faculty of a subject and matter? Or is it because Fire refines and Water cleanseth, and a Married Wife ought to continue pure and chast? Or is it because Fire without moisture doth not nourish, but is adust? as Water destitute of heat is Barren and Sluggish; so both the Male and Female apart be of no force, but a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of both in Marriage compleats Society: Or <hi>[is the meaning]</hi> that they must never forsake each other, but must Communicate in every For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, although there be no goods, yet they may
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46331:88"/> participate with each other in Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
               <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Why do they light at Nuptials five Torches, neither more nor less, which they call waxen Tapers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Whether it be [as <hi>Varro</hi> saith] that the Praetors use three, but more are permitted to the <hi>Aediles,</hi> and Married Persons do light the Fire at the <hi>Aediles</hi> Torches? Or is the reason of their using more numbers, that the odd number is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned better and perfecter upon other accounts, and therefore more adapted to Matrimony? for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven number admits of Division, and the equal Parts of opposition and repugnancy, when as the odd cannot be divided but being divided into Parts leaves always an inequality. The number five is most Matrimonial, for three is the first odd and two the first even, of which five is compounded, as of Male and Female.</p>
               <p>Or rather, because Light is a sign of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and its natural to a Woman, for the most part, to bring forth so far a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> five successively, and therefore they use five Torches. Or is it because they suppose that Married Persons have occasion for five Gods? <hi>viz. Jovial Jupiter, Jocund Juno, Venus, Suada,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> above all the rest, which Women invocate in their Travels and Child-bed Sickness?</p>
               <p>Quest. 3. <hi>What's the reason that seeing there is so many of</hi> Diana's <hi>Temples in</hi> Rome, <hi>the men refrain going into that only, which stands in</hi> Patricius-<hi>Street?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it upon the account of the fabulous Story, that a certain Man ravishing a Woman that was there Worshipping the Goddess, was torn in pieces by Dogs, and hence this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46331:89"/> practice arose that Men enter not in?</p>
               <p>Quest. 4. <hi>Why do they in all other Temples of</hi> Diana <hi>in the like manner, nail up Staggs horns against the Wall, when as in that of the Aventine they nail up Ox Horns?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it to put them in mind of an old casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty? For its said, that among the <hi>Sabines,</hi> one <hi>Antro Croatius</hi> had a very comely <hi>Ox,</hi> far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings all others in handsomeness and largeness, and being told by a certain Diviner, That he that should offer up that <hi>Ox</hi> in Sacrifice to <hi>Diana,</hi> on the Aventine, his City was determined by fate to be the greatest [in the World] and have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all <hi>Italy.</hi> This Man came to <hi>Rome,</hi> with an intention to Sacrifice his <hi>Ox</hi> there; but a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant acquainted King <hi>Servius</hi> privately with this privacy, but the King making it known to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> the Priest, <hi>Cornelius</hi> strictly commands <hi>Antro</hi> to wash in <hi>Tiber</hi> before he Sacrific'd, for the Law requires Men so to do, who Sacrifice acceptably; Wherefore whilst <hi>Antro</hi> went to wash, <hi>Servius</hi> took the opportunity to Sacrifice the <hi>Ox</hi> to the Goddess, and nailed up the Horns to the Wall in the Temple. These things are Storied by <hi>Juba</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> only <hi>Varro</hi> hath not described <hi>Antro</hi> by that Name, neither doth he say that the <hi>Sabine</hi> was choust by <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Priest, but by the <hi>Edituus</hi> [the Sexton.]</p>
               <p>Quest. 5. <hi>Wherefore is it that those that are fasly reported to be dead in foreign Countries, when they return, they receive them not in by the Doors, but getting up to the roof of the House, they let them in that way?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Verily the account which <hi>Varro</hi> gives of this matter, is altogether fabulous. For he saith,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46331:89"/> in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War, when there was a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Fight, a very false report was rumor'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many, as if they were slain, all of them returning home, in a little time dyed; but one of them who going to enter in at his doors, they shut together against him of their own accord, neither could they be opened by any that attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, this Man falling in a sleep before the Doors, saw an Apparition in his sleep, advising him to let himself down from the Roof into the House; who doing so, he lived happily and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an old Man, and hence the Custom was confirmed to After-ages. But consider if these things be not conformable to some <hi>Greek</hi> usages; for they do not esteem those pure, nor keep them company, nor suffer them to approach their Sacrifices, for whom was any Funeral carry'd forth, or Sepulchre made, as if they were dead, and they say that <hi>Aristinus</hi> being one that was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared in this sort of Superstition, sent to <hi>Delphos</hi> to beg and beseech of the God, a resolution of the present Scruples, which he had by reason of the Law. <hi>Pythia</hi> answered thus.</p>

                  <hi>Aristinus</hi> well understanding [the meaning of the <hi>Oracle</hi>] puts himself into the Womans hands, to be washed, wrapped in Swadling-clouts, and suck the Breasts in the same manner as when he was newly Born, and thus all others do, and such are called <hi>Hysteropotimus</hi>'s [<hi>i. e.</hi> one for whom a Funeral was made while living] but some say that the Ceremonies attending the <hi>Hysteropotimus</hi>'s were before <hi>Aristinus,</hi> and that the Custom was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46331:90"/> ancient: Wheerfore it is not to be wondered at a if the <hi>Romans,</hi> when once they suppose a Man buryed, and to have his lot among the dead, that they do not think it lawful for him to go in at the door, whereat they that are about to Sacrifice do go out, or those that have sacrificed do enter in, but they bid them ascend aloft into the air and descend from it's circumference, for they constantly offer their Sacrifices of purification in the open air.</p>

Even that thing was commonly reported and said to be done in many places (which it seems) was enterpiz'd by the <hi>Trojan</hi> Women, and in the confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> for after the Men arrived and went a-shoar, the Women set the Ships on fire, earnestly longing to be discharged of their roving and Sea-fairing condition, but dreading their Husbands displeasure, they fell on saluting their Kindred and Acquaintance that met them, by kissing and embracing, whereupon the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Anger being appeased, and they reconciled, they used for the future this kind of Complement towards them, or rather might this usage be granted to Women, as a thing that gained them Reputation and Interest, if they appeared hereby to have many and good Kindred and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Or was it that it being unlawful to Marry Kinswomen, a Courteous behaviour might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so far as a Kiss, and this was only retained
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46331:90"/> as a significant sign of Kindred, and a Note of familiar Converse among them; for in former time they did not Marry Women nigh by Blood, as now they Marry, not the Aunts, or Sisters, but of late they allowed the Marrying of Nices for this reason? A certain Man, mean in Estate, but on the other hand an honest and a popular Man among the Citizens, design'd to Marry his Neice being an Heiress, and to get an Estate by her, upon this account being accused, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taking little notice of the Accusation, so as to reprimand him, absolved him of the fault, and enacted it by vote, that it might be lawful for any Man to Marry so far as Neices, but prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all higher degrees [of Consanguinity.]</p>

Or is it, that they reputed a Gift the basest Sign of benevolence (for Strangers and they that have no love for us to give us Presents) they took away such a piece of Flattery from Marriage? That to love and be beloved should be devoid of Mercinariness, should be spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and for i'ts own sake and not for any thing else: Or because Women being corrupted by receiving gifts, are thereby especially brought to admit Strangers, it seemed to be a weighty thing [to require them] to love their own Husbands that gives them nothing.

Or rather is it, that they desire to enquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wives, whether they are in health, and that they may find them at home looking for them? Or because when the Husbands are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Women have more family concerns and business upon their hands, and there is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions and hurly burly among those that are within doors, therefore that the Wife may free her self from these things, and give a calm and pleasant reception to her Husband, she hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of his coming.</p>
               <p>Quest. 10. <hi>Wherefore do Men in Divine Service cover their Heads, but if they meet any honourable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46331:91"/> Personages, when they have their Hats on their heads, they are uncovered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is also to augment the difficulty, if the Story of <hi>Aeneas</hi> be true, that whilst <hi>Diomedes</hi> was passing by, he offered a Sacrifice with his head covered. Its rational and of consequence to cover our Heads before our Enemies, but when we meet our Friends and good Men to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This behaviour before the Gods is not absolutely necessary, but accidental, it continuing to be observed from him, <hi>[i. e. Aeneas.]</hi>

For they that are uncovered before Men of greater Power, do not thereby ascribe honour unto them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remove Envy from them, that they might not presume to demand the same kind of reverence which the Gods have, nor to endure it; or to rejoyce that they are served in the same manner, as they, but they worship the Gods in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, either shewing their unworthiness in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, by the covering of the Head, or rather fearing that some unlucky and ominous voice should come to them from abroad, whilst they are praying, therefore they pluck up their <hi>Coat</hi> about their <hi>Ears,</hi> that they strictly observed these things is manifest in that, when they went to consult the Oracle, they made a great din all about by the tinkling of Brass Kettles. Or is it as <hi>Castor</hi> saith, that the <hi>Roman</hi> usages were conformable to the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorick,</hi> notion, that the <hi>Daemon</hi> within us stands in need of the Gods without us, and we make sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to them with a covered Head, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bodies hiding and absconding of the Soul.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason? That whereas <hi>Aeneas</hi> hath instituted the covering of the Head [in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service] <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Sacrifice was much more ancient? Or is it that they be covered before Coelestial Gods, but they reckon <hi>Saturn</hi> an Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Terrestrial? Or is it that nothing of the Truth ought to be obscure and darkned? For the <hi>Romans</hi> repute <hi>Cronos</hi> time to be the Father of Truth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it because Glory is Splendid, Illustrious and Unveiled, for which cause Men are uncovered before good and honourable Persons; and for this reason they Worship a God that bears the name of Honour.</p>

               <p>

Or what if this notion meet with much contradiction? For it was on another day they were defeated in Battle which they calling <hi>Aliensis</hi> (from the River) do greatly abominate as unsuccessful, and whereas there be many unlucky days, they do not observe in all the Months alike, but every one in the Month he happens in, and its most improbable that all the next days after the Nones and Callends simply considered, should contract this Superstition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they solemnize some purifications and funeral rites to the <hi>Ghosts</hi> of the <hi>deceased,</hi> so that they have constituted the Three which hath been spoken of, as it were the chief and principle days for Festivals and Holy-days, designing the next following these to <hi>Daemons</hi> and deceased persons, which days they esteemed unfortunate and unfit for Action. And also the <hi>Grecians</hi> worshipping their Gods, at the New of the Moon, dedicated the next day to <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the second of the Cups was mingled on the behalf of the Male and Female <hi>Heroes.</hi> Moreover Time is altogether a Number, and a Unity which is the foundation of a Number, is of a Divine Nature: The Number next is two, contrary to the first, and is the first of even Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but an even Number is defective, imperfect and infinite; as again an odd number is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46331:96"/> definite and is compleat, therefore the Nones succeed the <hi>Calends</hi> on the Fifth day, the <hi>Ides</hi> follow the <hi>Nones</hi> on the Ninth, for unequals to terminate beginnings, but those even Numbers which are next after beginnings, have not that <hi>Preheminence</hi> nor <hi>Influence:</hi> Hence on such Days they take not any <hi>Actions</hi> or Journey in hand, wherefore that of <hi>Themistocles</hi> hath reason in it. The day after contended with the Feast-Day, saying, that the Feast-day truly had much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Toil, but she [the Day after the <hi>Feast</hi>] affords the Fruition of the Provision made for the Feast day, with much Leisure and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Feast-day answered after his wise, <hi>Thou speakest truth, but if I had not been, neither hadst thou been.</hi> These things spake <hi>Themistocles</hi> to the succeeding <hi>Athenian</hi> Officers of the Army, as that they could never have made any Figure in the World, had not he saved the City, when as therefore every Action and Journey worth our diligent Management, requires necessary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Preparation: The <hi>Romans</hi> of old made no Family Provision on Feast-days, nor were careful for any thing, but that they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Divine Service, and this they did with all their Might, as even now the Priests enjoyn them in their Sermons, when they address themselves to the Sacrifices. In like manner they do not rush presently after their Festival Solemnities, upon a Journey, or any Enterprize (because they were unprovided) but finished that Day in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving Domestick Affairs, and fitting themselves [for the intended Occasions abroad] as even at this day, after they have said their Prayers and finished their Devotion, they are wont to stay and sit still in the Temples, so that they did not

For they beautifie the Body so, but cannot the Soul, wherefore they follow it as gone before pure and white, being dismissed after it hath fought a great and various Warfare? Or is it that, that which is very mean and plain is most becoming in these things? for of Garmants dy'd of a Colour, some argue <hi>Luxury,</hi> others <hi>Vanity,</hi> neither may we say less of Black than of Sea-green or Purple, for verily Garments are deceitful, and so are Colours, and a thing that is naturally black, is not dy'd by Art but by Nature, and is blended with an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt</hi> Shade: Its only White therefore that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>unmixt,</hi> free from the Impurity of a Dye and unimitable, therefore most proper to those that are buried: for one that is dead is become simple, <hi>unmixt,</hi> and pure without Wealth or Guard, freed from the Body no otherwise then from a tinging Poyson.

As it's a prophane thing for him to strip himself naked in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Holy Place; so they did reverence the open Air and Firmament as being full of Gods and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46331:101"/> Daemons; wherefore we do many necessary things within doors, hiding and covering our selves in our Houses from the sight of the Gods; moreover some things are enjoyned to the Priest only, other things to all by a Law delivered by the Priest; for with us [in <hi>Greece</hi>] to wear a Crown, to wear long Hair, or to carry cold Iron by his side, or not enter into the <hi>Phocaean</hi> borders, are peculiar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per peices of the High Priest's Service, but not to taste latter, ripe fruits before the Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Equinoctial; or to cut a Vine before the Spring Equinoctial, are things required of all by the Chief Priest, each of these have their Season: It's after the same manner (as it appears) among the <hi>Romans</hi> it's peculiar to the Priest, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make use of a Horse, nor to be absent from home in a Journey more than three Nights, nor to put off his Hat (therefore he is called <hi>Flamen</hi>) many other things are enjoyned to all sorts of Men by the Priest; of which one is not to be anointed abroad in the open Air: For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have a great prejudice against dry Unction [<hi>i. e.</hi> without bathing] for they are of Opinion, that nothing hath been so great a cause to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of Slavery and effeminacy, than their Fencing and Wrestling Schools, insinuating so much Debauchery and Idleness into the Citizens, yea vitious sloth and buggery, yea that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the very Bodies of Youths, with sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; perambulations, dancing and delicious feeding, whereby they insensiby fell from the use of Arms, and instead of being good Soldiers and Horsemen, they loved to be called Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wrestlers, and prettey Men: It is hard therefore for them to avoid these mischiefs, who are unclothed in the open Air, but they that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is not the reason that an Oath is a kind of Test imposed on a Free People, but the Body and Mind of a Priest ought to be free from imposition? Or is it not unlikely that he will be disbelieved in smaller Matters, who is intrusted with Divine and greater? Or is it that every Oath concludes with an Execration of Perjury, and an Execration is a fearful and grievous thing. Hence neither is it thought fit that Priests should curse others, wherefore the Priestess at <hi>Athens</hi> was commended for refusing to curse <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> when the common People required her to do it, for she said, <hi>I am a Votary, not a Cursing Priestess.</hi> Or is it that the danger of Perjury is of a publick Nature?

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason (as <hi>Antistes Labeo</hi> hath told us) that <hi>Hortari</hi> signifies to quicken one to an Action, and that <hi>Horta</hi> is such a Goddess as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,</hi> and <hi>Excites</hi> to good things, they suppose therefore that she ought always to be in business, never procrastinate therefore not to be shut up or lockt? Or is it rather as now they call her <hi>Hora</hi> (the first Syllable pronounced long) as a kind of an active and busie Goddess, being very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and careful, and they were of opinion that she was never lazy or indeed of humane affairs; Or is it that this is a Greek name, as many others of them be, and signifies a Goddess that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oversees and inspects Affairs, and therefore her Temples is always open as one that never slumbers nor sleeps?

Or is it that they preferred no Man as fit for the Magistracy, for the sake of his Birth, Riches or Honours, but for his Wounds and Cicatrices, and that these might be visible to them that came about them, they came without upper Cloaths to their Elections? Or as by Courteous Behaviour, Supplication and Submission, so by humbling themselves in nakedness, they gained on the affections of the common People.</p>

Or because the Wife joyns with the Husband in consecration, as there are many sacred Rites that ought not to be performed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Wife be present, but to Marry another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he hath lost the former Wife, is not perhaps easie to do; and besides its not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is a certain Tradition, that when the Women were prohibited the use of Chariots drawn by a Yoke of <hi>Oxen,</hi> they conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not to be got with Child and breed Children, and in this manner to be revenged on their Husbands, until they had revoked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and gratifyed them, which being done Children were begot, and the Women becoming

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it not because <hi>Carmentas</hi> Women come next after those Sacrifices, and the race of the <hi>Peinarii</hi> succeeds, Hence they are raised from their Feasts, others coming in the places are called <hi>Pinarii?</hi> Or is it upon the account of that fabulous Story of the Coat and Dejanara?</p>
               <p>Quest. 61. <hi>What is the reason that its forbidden to mention, enquire after, or name the chief Tutelary and Guardian God of</hi> Rome, <hi>whether Male or Female?

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason (as some <hi>Roman</hi> Histories tells us) that there being certain kinds of Evocations and Enchantments, with which they think their Gods may be invited out by their Enemies, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and dwell with them, they feared lest this mischief should befal them for others? as the <hi>Tyrians</hi> are said therefore to bind fast their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with Cords, but others when they will send any of them to washing or purifying, they require Sureties from their return; so that the <hi>Romans</hi> reckoned they had their God in most safe and secure Custody, he being <hi>unexpressible</hi> and <hi>unknown?</hi> Or is it as <hi>Homer</hi> hath verified?</p>

               <p>Quest 62. <hi>Why among them that are called</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials <hi>(in Greek Peace-makers) the Ash-bearers, he that was named</hi> Peter Patratus <hi>was acounted the chiefest? But this must be one who hath his Father living, and Children of his own, and he hath even at this time a certain priviledge and trust; for the Praetors commit to those Mens trust the Persons of such, who by reason of comliness and beauty, stand in need of an exact and chast Guardianship?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason, that they must be such whose Children reverence them and they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their Parents? Or doth the name it self suggest a rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or is it that he ought to be Overseer of Oaths and Peace, and according to <hi>Homer,</hi> must see before and behind: He is such an one especially who hath a Son for whom he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults, and a Father with whom he may Consult.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it, that of old the Kings did perform the most and greatest sacred rites, and they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifices together with the Priests; but when they kept not within the bounds of Moderation, and became proud and insolent, most of the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians depriving them of their Authority, and left

Hence there being a certain Sacrifice kept by tradition in the Market place, near the <hi>Comitia,</hi> which as soon as the King [<hi>i. e.</hi> the chief Priest] hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he immediately withdraws himself by flight out of the Market place.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46331:108"/> with Thongs, the word signifying to cleanse.

Or is it because the Dogs do bark at, and perplex the <hi>Luperci</hi> as they scout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City?

                  </q> Therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> say that <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it this as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> do, who make little things Symbals of great matters, as forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to sit down upon a Bushel, and to stir up the fire with a Sword; So that the Ancients used many enigmatical Ceremonies, especially about their Priests, and such was this of the Lanthorn, for the Lanthorn is like the Body encompassing the Soul, the Soul being the light within side, and the Understanding and Judgment ought to be always open and quick sighted, and never to be shut up or blown out, and when the Winds blow, the Birds are unsettled and do not afford sound prognosticks, by reason of their Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and Irregularity in flying, by this usage, therefore they teach that their Southsayers must not Prognosticate when there are high Winds, but in still and calm Weather, when they can use their open Lanthorns.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is not this the reason? that its a significant sign, that whilst they are employed about divine Matters, they ought not to be in any pain; nor have any sore or passion in their Minds, but to be cheerful, sincere, and without distraction? Or it is but rational, if no Man may offer an Oblation, that hath a Sore, nor use such Birds for Southsaying, that much more they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should be free from these blemishes, and be clean, sincere and sound, when they go about to inspect divine Prodigies, for an Ulcer seems

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it because he was of a mean Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and in a low condition, being born of a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Woman, and by Fortune came to be King of <hi>Rome?</hi> Or did not that change of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition manifest the greatness of his Fortune, rather then the smalness? But <hi>Servius</hi> most of all of them seems to ascribe divine influence to Fortune, giving thereby a reputation to all his Enterprises; For he did not only build the Temple of hopeful Fortune that averteth Evil, that is mild, primogenial and masculine: But there is a Temple also of his own proper For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, another of Fortune turning to him, another of hopeful Fortune, and the fourth of Virgin Fortune, and why should any one mention any more Names? seeing there is a Temple also of ensnaring Fortune which they name <hi>Viscata</hi> as it were ensnaring us when we are as yet a far off, and enforcing us upon business. Consider also, and learn that a great Matter may be effected by a small peice of Fortune, and it often falls out, whether a small thing be done or not done, that great things are effected by some, or do come to naught: He built therefore a Temple of small Fortune, teaching us to take care of our business, and not contemn the things that happen by reason of their smallness.</p>
               <p>Quest. 75. <hi>Why did they not extinguish a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but suffered it to burn out of its own accord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason? That they adored it, as being related, and akin to unquenchable and eternal Fire. Or is it a significant Ceremony,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46331:110"/> that we are not to kill and destroy any animated Creature that is harmless, Fire being as it were an Animal? For it both needs nourishment and moves it self, and when its extinguish'd it makes a Noise as if it were then slain? Or doth this usage instruct us, that we ought not to make waste of Fire or Water, or any other necessary things that we have a superabundance of, but suffer those that have need to use them, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to others, when we our selves have no use for them.</p>
               <p>Quest. 76. <hi>Why do they that would be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others in Gentility, wear little Moons on their Shoes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason (as <hi>Castor</hi> saith) that this is a Symbol of the place of habitation, that is said to be in the Moon, that after death, Souls should have the Moon under their Feet again? Or was this a fashion of renown among Families of greatest Antiquity? Who were the <hi>Arcadians</hi> of <hi>Evanders</hi> Posterity, that were called Men before the Moon: or is it as many other customs, so this to put Men in Mind, who are lofty and high minded, of the mutability of human Affairs to either side, setting the Moon before them as an Example,
<q>
                     <l>When first she comes from dark to light,</l>
                     <l>Triming her Face, becomes fair bright,</l>
                     <l>Increasing, till she's full in sight</l>
                     <l>And then declines, leaves nought but night.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Or was this for a Doctrine of Obedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that they would have us not discontented under it, but as the Moon doth willingly obey her superior and conform unto him, always
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46331:111"/> vamping after the Rays of the Sun (as <hi>Parmenides</hi> hath it) so they that are Subjects to any Prince, should be contented with their lower Station, in the enjoyment of Power and Dignity derived from him.</p>
               <p>Quest. 77. <hi>Why are they of an Opinion that the Year is</hi> Jupiters, <hi>but the Months belong to</hi> Juno?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it because <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> Reign over the invisible Gods, but the Sun and Moon over the visible? And the Sun it verily causeth the Year, and the Moon the Months, neither ought we to think that they are bare Images of them, but the Sun is very <hi>Jupiter</hi> materially, and the Moon very <hi>Juno</hi> materially; therefore they name <hi>Heras Juno, a Juvenescendo</hi> the name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a thing that is new or grows young, from the nature of the Moon, and they call her <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi> as it were bright, or shining, and they are of opinion that she helps Women in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Purgations, and Travel pains, whence is that of the Poet;
<q>
                     <l>By Sea-green Pole beset with Stars,</l>
                     <l>By Moon that hastens birth, —</l>
                  </q> For they suppose that Women have the easiest Travel at the full of the Moon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if this be not true? but the dialect deludes so many, for they render <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46331:111"/> and call amiss <hi>sinistrum?</hi> Or is it as <hi>Dionysius</hi> saith? When <hi>Ascanius</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas</hi> had pitched bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle against <hi>Mezentius,</hi> a flash of Lightning por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Victory (as they Prognosticated) came on his left hand, and for the future they observed it so? or as some others say that this hapned to <hi>Aeneas?</hi> Moreover the <hi>Thebans</hi> routing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering their Enemies by the left Wing of the Army at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> they continued in all Battles to give the left Wing the preheminence: Or is it rather as <hi>Juba</hi> thinks? to those that look toward the East, the North part is on the left hand, which verily some make the right hand and superior part of the World. Consider whether the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers do not as it were corroborate left hand things, as the weaker by nature, and do intimate as if they introduced a supyly of that defect of power that is in them? Or is it that they think that things Terrestial and Mortal, stand directly over against Heavenly and Divine things, and do conjecture that the things which to us are on the left hand, the Gods send down from their right hand?</p>
               <p>Quest. 79. <hi>Why was it lawful to bring the Bones of one that had triumphed (after he was dead and burnt) into the City, and lay them there, as</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>the</hi> Liparaean <hi>hath told us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it for the Honour they had for the deceased? for they granted, that not only Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and other Eminent Persons, but also their Off-Spring should be buryed in the Market place, according to <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Fabricius,</hi> and they say when the posterity of these Persons died, they were brought into the Market place, and a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Firebrand put under them, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately taken away, using the Honorary without

               <p>Quest. 80. <hi>Why did they that publickly Feasted the Triumphers, humbly request the Consuls, and by Messengers sent, did beseech them not to cme to their Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it that it was necessary to give the supream Place and most honourable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Triumpher, and wait upon him home after Supper? whereas the Consuls being present they might do such things to none other but they.</p>
               <p>Quest. 81. <hi>Why did not the Tribune of the People wear a Purple Garment, when as each of the other Magistrates wore one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if the Tribune is not a Magistrate at all? Neither hath Lictors, neither sitting in Tribunal did he determine Causes, neither do they as the rest enter upon their Office at the beginning of the Year, neither do they cease when a Dictator is chosen, but though they translated all Magistratick Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they continue still, being as it were no Magstrates, but holding another kind of rank, as some Rhetoricians will not have a Prohibition to be Judicial proceeding, seeing it doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to Judicial proceeding, for the one brings in an Action at Law, and gives Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, but the other Non-suits it and dismiseth the cause: after the like manner they are of opinion that Tribuneship is rather a Curb to Magistracy, and that its an Order standing in opposition to Government, rather then a piece of Government it self, for the Tribunes Office and Authority is to withstand the Magistrates Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46331:112"/> even to curtalize his Extravagant Power: May not a Man tell you these things and such as these if he will use freeness of Speech? For Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneship taking its Original from the People; Popularity is its strong hold, and its a great thing not to carry it above the rest of the People, but to be like the Citizens they have to do with, in Gesture, Habit and Diet. State indeed becomes a Consul and Pretor, but as for a Tribune (as <hi>Gaius Curio</hi> saith) he must be one that even is trampled upon, not grave in Countenance nor difficult of Access, nor harsh to the Rabble, but more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to them then to others. Hence it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the Tribunes Doors should not be shut but open Night and Day, as a Haven and place of Refuge for distressed People, and how much the more condescending his outward deportment is, by so much the more doth he increase in his Power, for they dignifie him as one of publick use, and to be resorted to of all sorts, even as an <hi>Altar,</hi> therefore by the reverence they give him, he is Sacred, Holy and Inviolable; and when he makes a Publick Progress, its a Law that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one should cleanse and purifie the Body as defiled.</p>
               <p>Quest. 82. <hi>Why are the chief Officers rods car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried bound together with the Axes fastned to them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if it be a significant Ceremony, to shew that a Magistrates anger ought not to be rash and ungrounded? Or is it that while the rods are leasurely unloosing, they make delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and delay in their Anger, so that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they change their Sentence as to the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Now whereas some sort of Crimes are
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46331:113"/> curable, some uncureable, the Rods correct the Corrigible, but the Axes are to cut off the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible.</p>
               <p>Quest. 83. <hi>What is the reason that the</hi> Romans, <hi>when they were informed that the</hi> Barbarians <hi>called</hi> Bletonienses, <hi>were about to Sacrifice a Man to the Gods, sent for their Magistrates pretending to punish them, but when they made it appear that they did it in obedience to a certain Law, they dismissed them, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the like Action for the future, when as they themselves not many years preceding, buried two men and two Women alive in the Beast Market, two of them were Greeks and two Gauls? For it seems absurd to do this Fact themselves, and yet to reprimand the</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians <hi>as if they had committed prophaneness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if this be the reason that they reckoned it prophane to Sacrifice a Man to the Gods, but necessary to the Daemons? Or were they of opinion that they that did such things by Custom or Law, sinned; but as for themselves they did it being enjoyned to it by the <hi>Sybils</hi> Books? For its reported that one <hi>Elvia</hi> a Virgin riding on Horse-back, was struck with lightning and cast from her Horse, and the Horse found lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and She naked, as if on set purpose her Coats had been turned up from her secret parts, also her Shooes, Rings, Head gear all lay scattered up and down here and there, her Tongue also hanging out of her Mouth, insomuch that the Diviners declared, that it was an intollerable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the Holy Virgins, that it should be published, and that some part of the abuse did touch the <hi>Cavaleirs.</hi> A servant of a certain <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian Cavaleir</hi> informed, that three Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, <hi>Emilia, Licinia</hi> and <hi>Martia,</hi> about the same place were defloured, and for a long time played
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46331:113"/> the Whores with some Men, among whom was <hi>Bytetius</hi> the said Informers Master, the Virgins being convict were punished, the fact appearing hainous, it was thought meet that the Priest should consult the Books of the <hi>Sybils:</hi> Where there were Oracles found foretelling these things would come to pass for mischief to the Re-publick, and for the aversion of the impending calamity enjoyned them, to provide two Grecians and two Gauls, and bury them alive in that place, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the appeasing some alien and foreign Daemons.</p>
               <p>Quest. 84. <hi>Why do they take the beginning of the day from the midnight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is the reason that the Common-weal had a military constitution at the first? For many matters of concern were managed with Lamps by Night: Or did they make Sun-rising the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of business, and the night for preparation to it; For men ought to come prepared to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not be in preparation when they should be doing, as <hi>Myso</hi> is reported to have said to <hi>Chylo</hi> the wise, when he was making a Fan in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Or as the Noon-tide to many is the time for finishing publick and weighty Affairs, so it seems meet to make midnight the beginning, which thing hath this confirmation, that a Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would make no League or Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Afternoon. Or is it possible to take the beginning and end of the day from Sun-rising to Sun-setting, as the vulgar measure the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day by sence, to be the first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Sun, and take the first beginning of the night to be the compleat withdrawment from our sight; whence we shall have no Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but the night which we suppose comes nearest
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46331:114"/> in equality to the day, that will be manifestly shorter then the day by the Diameter of the Sun, which absurdity the Mathematicks going about to salve, have determined, that where the Center of the Sun toucheth the Horizontal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, there to be the true parting point between day and night, which indeed contradicts sence, for it will follow, that whilst there is much light above the earth, yea the Sun illuminating of us, that we will not for all this confess it to be day, but that it is yet night, whereas then it is hard from the rising and setting of the Sun, to take the beginning of the day, by reason of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned absurdities, it remains to take the <hi>Zenith</hi> or the <hi>Nadir</hi> for the beginning, the last is best, for the Suns course from noon is by way of declination from us, but from midnight he takes his course towards us, as Sun rising comes on.</p>
               <p>Quest. 85. <hi>Wherefore did they not in ancient times suffer Women to grind, or play the Cooks?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Happily because they remembred the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that they made with the <hi>Sabines;</hi> for after they had rob'd them of their Daughters, and fighting many battles became reconciled, among other Articles of agreement this was recorded, that a Wife was not to grind nor play the Cook for a <hi>Roman</hi> Husband.</p>
               <p>Quest. 86. <hi>Why do they not marry Wives in the Month of</hi> May?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason, because <hi>May</hi> is between <hi>April</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> concerning which Months they have an opinion, that that is sacred to <hi>Venus,</hi> this to <hi>Juno</hi> both of them being Nuptial Goddesses, they either take an opportunity a little before <hi>May,</hi> or tarry till it be over? Or is it that in this Month they offer the greatest Expiatory Sacrifice, for
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46331:114"/> now they cast the Images of Men from a Bridge into the River, formerly Men themselves, moreover because its by Law required that the <hi>Flaminica,</hi> the reputed Priestess of <hi>Juno</hi> should be most sowrly sullen, during the time, neither to wash or trim up her self? Or is it because the vulgar <hi>Latines</hi> in this Month purifie themselves for the dead? And therefore perhaps they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Mercury</hi> in this Month, and from <hi>Maja</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his Name: Or as some say, <hi>Maius</hi> Elder, <hi>June</hi> as it were <hi>Junior</hi> Younger, taking its Name from younger Age? For Youth is most suitable to Matrimony, as <hi>Euripides</hi> hath said,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if it be a significant Ceremony, that they took their first Wives in Marriage by force of Arms and War? Or that they may instruct them, that they are to dwell with Husbands that are Souldiers and Warriers, that they should put on such Ornamental Atire that is not <hi>Luxurious</hi> or <hi>Lascivious,</hi> but plain, as even <hi>Licurgus</hi> commanded that all the Gates and tops of Houses should be built with Saw and Hatchet, and to use no other sort of Workmans Instrument about them, yea he rejected all Gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Superfluity? Or doth this action parabol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically intimate divorce, as that Marriage can be dissolved only by the Sword? Or is it that most of these Nuptial Ceremonies are relating to <hi>Juno?</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:46331:115"/> for a Spear is decreed sacred to <hi>Juno,</hi> and most of her Statues are supported by a Spear, and she is Sirnamed the <hi>Quiritis</hi> Goddess, and a Spear of old was called <hi>Quiris,</hi> wherefore they Sirname <hi>Mars, Quirinus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it because there are many other repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitories for the Gods about the City, which they call <hi>Luci</hi> Groves, and the revenue of those they <hi>expend</hi> upon the said Plays?</p>
               <p>Quest. 89. <hi>Why do they call the</hi> Quirinalia the Feast of Fools?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it because they set apart that day for those that were unacquainted with their own Tribes and Courts as <hi>Juba</hi> saith? Or was it for them that did not Sacrifice as the rest did in the Fornicals, by reason of Business, or long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or Ignorance, it was allowed to them to solemnize that Feast upon this day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is the reason of their naming no other God, because they are of opinion that <hi>Hercules</hi> was but a half God, and <hi>Evander</hi> built an Altar to him, and brought him a Sacrifice, whilst he was yet here among Men? and of all Creatures he had most enmity to a Dog, for this Creature always held him hard to it, as did <hi>Cerberus,</hi> and that which most of all prejudiced him, was when <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cymnius</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeonus</hi> was slain for a Dogs sake, by the <hi>Hippocoondite,</hi> he was necessitated to take up the Cudgles, and as he lost many others of his Friends, so his Brother <hi>Iphicles.</hi>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46331:116"/> Birds of Prey; for first he medles not with any living Creature, neither doth he destroy any thing that hath breath in it, as Eagles, Hawks and Owles do, but lives only upon dead Carcases, and next that he passeth by all such of his kind <hi>(i. e. Birds)</hi> for none ever saw a Vulture feeding on a Bird, as Eagles and Hawks, which do for the most part pursue Birds, as themselves be, and slay them even as <hi>Aesculus</hi> hath it.</p>

Moreover if it be (as the Egyptians fabulously pretend) that the whole kind of them is of the Female Sex, and that they conceive by the reception of the East wind into their Bodies, as the Trees do by receiving the South, its most probable, that very certain and sound Prognostick may be made from them, whereas in other Birds (there being so many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, flights and pursuits about Copulation) there are great disturbances and uncertainties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is this the reason, that they begin with those things that savour of most frugality, and such things that want not much charge and trouble? Or is it in grateful commemoration of what these Creatures did of old, when the <hi>Gauls</hi> invaded <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> scalled the Walls
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46331:117"/> of the Capitol by Night, the Geese were sensible of it, when the Dogs were asleep, they with their Gagling awaked the Watch? Or seeing the Censors are the Conservers of such things as are of greatest and most necessary concern, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and narrowly inspect them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the publick Sacrifices, Lives, Manners and Diet of Men, they presently set before their Consideration the most vigilant Creature, and by the Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these, they instruct the Citizens not to disregard or neglect sacred things.

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is the reason (as some say) that they will have none to know the Mysteries of the Priests who is not a Priest? Or that the Augur is bound by Oath to discover to none the Management of sacred things, therefore they refuse to absolve him from his Oath, when he is reduced to a private capacity? Or is it that an Augur is not a Title of Honor and Dignity, but of Skill and Art? Its therefore the like case to depose a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian from being a Musitian, or a Physician from being a Physician, with that of prohibiting a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from being a Diviner; Seeing they cannot take away his faculty, though they deprive him of the Title.

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> What if this were for the honor of the Wives which were taken by force? For as many other things so this might be one of the injunctions laid on their posterity: Or did they it in honour of <hi>Tarquins</hi> Manhood? For is reported of him, that whilst he was but a Boy, being engaged in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle against the <hi>Latins;</hi> and <hi>Tuscans,</hi> charging his Enemies, fell from his Horse, yet animating those <hi>Romans</hi> which were engaged in the charge, he led them on couragiously; the Enemies were put to a remarkable rout, and 6000 slain; whereupon he had this Badg of Honour bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him by his Father the King: Or was it that by the Ancients, it was neither leud nor disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to lye with beautiful Slaves (as now the Comedies testifie) but they resolvedly abstain from freeborn Servants, and least by coming accidentally on naked Boys, they should igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly transgress, the Free-boys wore this mark of distinction?

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46331:118"/> before they have put off the badg of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

But consider whether they do not wear it for the Moons sake?

               <p>Quest. 102. <hi>Why do they name Boys at nine days old, Girls at eight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Perhaps its a natural reason <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Girls are forwarder, for the Female grows up and comes to full stature and perfection before the Male, but they take the days after the Seventh, because the Seventh is dangerous to Infants, by reason of the Navel-string, for with many it falls off at Seven days old, and until its fallen off, an Infant is more like a Plant then an Animal. Or is it as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> reckon <hi>(viz.)</hi> The even number of the Feminine, and the odd num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Masculine? For its a fruitful number and excels the even in respect of its composition. And if these numbers be divided into unites, the even like a Female hath an empty space in the middle, the odd number always leaves a Segment to fill up the middle, wherefore this is fit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Male, that to the Female? Or is it thus? that of all numbers Nine is the first squared number made of Three, which is an odd and perfect number. But Eight is the first Cube made of Two an even number, whence a Male ought to be square, superexcelling and compleat; but a Woman like a Cube constant, a good House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, and no gadding Gossip. This also may be
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46331:119"/> added, that as eight is a Cube from the Root Two, and nine a Quadrat from the Root Three, so the Female makes use of two names, and the Males of three.</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it not verily as the <hi>Graecians</hi> suppose, and as the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> say in their determinations, its because that they are begot of some promiscuous and common Sperm. But <hi>Spurius</hi> is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong former Names, as <hi>Sextus, Decimus, Cajus,</hi> neither do the <hi>Romans</hi> write all the Letters of the first Name, but one Letter as <hi>T.</hi> for <hi>Titius, L.</hi> for <hi>Lucius, M.</hi> for <hi>Marcus,</hi> or with two Letters as <hi>Ti.</hi> for <hi>Tiberius, Cn.</hi> for <hi>Cnaeus,</hi> or with Three, as <hi>Sex</hi> for <hi>Sextus,</hi> and <hi>Ser.</hi> for <hi>Servius,</hi> and <hi>Spurius</hi> is of those that are written with Two Letters, <hi>Sp.</hi> and with these Letters they write without Father, <hi>S.</hi> for <hi>fine,</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> for <hi>patre,</hi> which truly hath caused some mistake when as <hi>Spurius</hi> and <hi>sine patre</hi> are writ with the same Letters. Moreover we may meet with another reason, but its more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.

Or rather is it because its decent for Virgins to Marry with more then a few present, but for Widows to Marry with a great many present is undecent? For the first Marriage is zealously affected, the second to be deprecated, yea they are ashamed while their first Husband lives to Marry a second Husband, and when they dye they lament them. Hence they are pleased more with silence then with Tumults and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous doings, the Feasts too do attract the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People to them, that they cannot be at leasure for such Wedding solemnities. Or was it that they that rob'd the <hi>Sabines</hi> of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were Virgins, on the Feast-day raised thereby a War, and looked therefore upon it as unlucky, to Marry Virgins on Holy-days?</p>

For the Wheat neither hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued what it was, neither is it made into Bread as it must be, but it hath lost the faculty of Seed, and hath not attained to useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Food. Wherefore the Poet hath named Meal, by a Metaphor, as it were Corn that is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46331:120"/> spoiled and destroyed by grinding Leaven, as its made by Corruption, so it corrupts the Mass that is mingled with, for its made thereby looser and weaker, and fermentation is a kind of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which if it be over much, it makes the Bread sowr and spoils it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Is it because Custom makes them averse enough to raw flesh? Or for the same reason that makes them averse to Meal, doth also make them averse to Flesh; for its neither a living Creature, nor drest Food. Roasting or boiling, being an alteration and change, it inverts its form; but fresh and raw Flesh offers not a pure and unpolluted object to the Eye, but such as is offensive to the Eye, and like that of a raw Wound.</p>
               <p>Quest. 111. <hi>Why did they require the Priest to abstain from a Dog and a Goat, neither to touch nor name them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it that they abominated the Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and stink of a Goat? Or that they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it to be a diseased Creature? For it seems this Animal is more seised with the Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then other Creatures? and contagious to them that eat or touch it, while it hath this Disease, they say the Cause is the straitness of the Wind-pipes, often intercepting the Breath, a sign of which they make the smallness of their Voice to be, for it happens to Men that are Epileptical, that they utter a Voice sounding much like the bleat of a Goat. Now in a Dog there may be less of Laciviousness and of an ill scent, although some say that a Dog is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go into the High street of <hi>Athens,</hi> no
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46331:121"/> not into the Island <hi>Delium,</hi> by reason of their open coition, as if Kine, Swine and Horses did use coition in Bed-Chambers, but not openly and lawlesly. They acknowledge the true reason to be, because a Dog is a quarrelsom Creature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expel Dogs out of Sanctuaries and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Temples, giving safe access to suppliants for refuge, wherefore it is very likely that the Priest of <hi>Jupiter</hi> being an animated and sacred Image granted for refuge to Petitioners and Suppliants, do banish or fright away none; for which cause a Couch was set for him in the Porch of the House, and they that fell on their Knees before him, had indemnity from stripes or punishment that day, and if one in Fetters came and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed he was unloosed, but bound Prisoners they brought not from abroad in at the Door, but let them down from the Roof of the House, it would be therefore no advantage, that he should carry himself so mild and courteous, if there were a Dog at the Door, scaring and frighting them that Petition for Sanctuary: Neither did the Ancients at all repute this Creature clean for he is offered in Sacrifice to none of the Celestial Gods, but being sent to <hi>Hecata</hi> an infernal Goddess, at the three-cross way for a Supper, takes a share in averting Calamities, and in Expiations. In <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi> they cut Puppies in Pieces to <hi>Mars,</hi> that most cruel God. In <hi>Boetia</hi> publick expiation is made by passing between the Parts of a Dog divided in twain. But the <hi>Romans</hi> sacrifice a Dog in the cleansing Month, on the Feast day of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which they call <hi>Lupercalia.</hi> Hence it was not, without cause to prohibit them, whose charge

Not that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> do dread and refrain from these things, but prohibit other things by these, for to go under a Vine hath reference to Wine, because its not lawful for a Priest to be drunk, for the Wine is above the heads of those that are drunk and they are depraved and debased thereby; Whereas it is requisite that they should be above pleasure and conquer it, but not be subdued by it. As for the Ivy, it being unfruitful and useless to Men as also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and by reason of its infirmity stands in need of other Trees to clime upon, though by its shaddow and sight of its greeness, it doth <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch</hi> the Vulgar, what if they judge it not convenient that a Diviner should have any insignificant thing in his House, and be <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with that which takes up ground, and is pernicious to other <hi>Plants</hi> that bears it up? Hence Ivy is forbidden to the Celestial Priests, and neither at <hi>Atbens</hi> in <hi>Juno</hi>'s Sacrifices, nor at <hi>Thebes</hi> in those belonging to <hi>Venus,</hi> can any wild Ivy be seen, <hi>though in Pharmacys</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals</hi> (which are Services for the most part performed in the dark) it is to be found.

               <p>Quest. 113. <hi>Why are not those Priests allowed to take upon them or attempt civil Authority, but for honour sake have a Lictor, a</hi> sella curulis, <hi>as it were in some kind of retribution, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Magistracy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it because in some places of <hi>Greece</hi> the dignity of Priesthood was equal with King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and therefore they designed not ordinary Persons to be Priests? Or rather because they have therefore appointed Office employments, whereas the Charge of Kings is immethodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and indefinite, it would not be possible, if both fell out at the same time, that he should be able to attend both, but must of necessity neglect one (both pressing together upon him) sometimes neglect the worship of God, and sometimes injure the Subjects. They that make inspection into civil Government, see that there is no less necessity, then power attending the Administration. For the Ruler of the People (whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls a Physitian) doth see weighty Matters, and hath to do with weighty Matters, and from other Mens Calamities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his own proper troubles, so they thought
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46331:122"/> him not sacred enough to Sacrifice to the Gods, and manage the Sacrifices, being present at the Condemnation and Execution of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and often of some of his own Kindred and Families, which thing often happened to <hi>Brutus.</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This was one of the Women taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which they brought into the Market-place, and set her upon a certain Stone to be seen of all, from thence they took her and set her on Ass-back, and led her round about the City, and afterwards set her up again upon the Stone, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rest of her life under disgrace; her they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46331:123"/> called <hi>Onobatis</hi> [the Woman that rode upon an Ass] hence the abominated the Stone as unclean. There was also a certain Magistrate among them, called <hi>Phylactes</hi> [a Conservator] he that had this Office for the rest of his time, kept the Prison, but at the nocturnal Convention of the Senators, he came into the Counsel, and laying hands on the Kings led them forth, and detained them in Custody until the Senate had determined concerning them, whether they had acted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously or no, who passed Sentence in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Country of <hi>Megaris</hi> was anciently inhabited by Vilages, the Inhabitants being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five Parts, and they were called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raens, Piraens,</hi> and <hi>Megarins, Cynoscorens,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prodiscians,</hi> these the <hi>Corinthians</hi> drew into a Civil War (for they always contrived to bring the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garins</hi> into their Power) yet they waged War with much moderation and neighbourly designs, for no Man did at all injure the Husbandman, and there was a stated Ransom determined for all that were taken Captive. And this they received after the release of the Prisoner and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but he that took the Captive Prisoner brought him home, gave him entertainment, and then gave him liberty to depart to his own House, wherefore he that brought in the price of his Ransom, was applauded and remained the Friend of him that received it, and was called <hi>Doryxenus,</hi> from his being a Captive by the Spear, but he that dealt fraudulently was reputed an unjust and unfaithful Person, not only by the Souldiers but by the Citizens also.</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> They say that the <hi>Tyrenes</hi> took away by force from <hi>Bauro</hi> the Daughters and Wives of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> at which time they inhabited <hi>Lemnus</hi> and <hi>Imber,</hi> from whence being driven they came to <hi>Laconica,</hi> and fell into such a commixture with that People, even so far as to beget Children on the native Women, so that by reason of Jealousie and Calumnies, they were again constrained to leave <hi>Laconica,</hi> and with their Wives and Children to waft over into <hi>Creet,</hi> having <hi>Pollis</hi> with his Brother their Governours; where waging War with the Inhabitants of <hi>Creet,</hi> they were fain to permit many of them that were slain in Battle, to lie unburied, in that at first they had no leasure, by reason of the War and Peril they were in, and afterwards they shunned the touching of the dead Corpses, being corrupted by time and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, wherefore <hi>Pollis</hi> contrived to bestow cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dignities, Priviledges and Immunities, some of which on the Priests of the Gods and some on

               <p>Quest. 22. <hi>What was the Sepulchre of the Boys at</hi> Calcidon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Cothus</hi> and <hi>Arclus</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zuthus</hi> came to dwell in <hi>Euba,</hi> the <hi>Aeolians</hi> possessing the greatest part of the Island at that time. The Oracle told <hi>Cothos</hi> that <hi>he should prosper and conquer his Enemies, if he had bought the Country,</hi> into which therefore, going up a little after, he happened to meet with some Children playing by the Sea side, whereupon he fell to play with them, conforming himself to their humors, shewed them many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish Toys, but seeing the Children very desirous to have them, refused to give them any upon any other terms then to receive Land for them, the Boys taking up some <hi>Earth</hi> from the <hi>Ground,</hi> gave it to him, receiving the Toys, and he departed: The <hi>Aeolians</hi> (perceiving what was done, and the Enemies sailing in upon them) moved by Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Grief, slew the Children and buried them near the way side that goes from the City to <hi>Enripus,</hi> and that place is called the Sepulcre of the Children.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It was a custom among those that lost any of their Kindred or Acquaintance, presently after mourning, to Sacrifice to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and thirty days after to <hi>Mercury,</hi> for they are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that as the Earth receives the Bodies of the deceased, so <hi>Mercury</hi> receives their Souls, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them Barley to <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Minister, they take the flesh of the Sacrifice and extinguishing the Fire as polluted, but kindling it again by others, they boil the Flesh, calling it <hi>Encnisma.</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> For we must not give credit to those that say that such are called <hi>Aliterii</hi> who in the time of dearth, watch the Miller and steal the Corn. But he was called <hi>Alastor</hi> who did exploits not to be forgotten, but had in remembrance for a long time. <hi>Aliterius</hi> is he who is fit to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided and observed upon the account of his Knavery.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it because <hi>Ochimus</hi> espoused his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cydippe</hi> to <hi>Ocridion,</hi> but <hi>Cercaphus</hi> who was Brother to <hi>Ochimus,</hi> falling in love with the Maid, perswaded the Cryer (for it was the Custom to fetch the Spouses by the Cryer) that he might obtain her, to bring her to him this being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done, <hi>Cercaphus</hi> got the Maid and fled, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when <hi>Ochimus</hi> was grown old, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46331:133"/> remarks on <hi>Arcadia</hi>) that some that went into the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> unawares, were delivered up to the <hi>Phliasians</hi> by the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and by the <hi>Phliasians</hi> to the <hi>Megarins,</hi> and by the <hi>Megarins</hi> to the <hi>Thebans</hi> which inhabit about <hi>Eleuthera,</hi> where they are detained under Rain, Thunder, and other direful Judgments from Heaven, and upon this account some say this place was called <hi>Eleutheras,</hi> but the report is not true, that he that enters into the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> casts no shadow, though it hath had a firm belief, and what if this be the reason of that report; that the Air converted into Clouds looks darkly on them that go in? Or that he that goes in falls down dead? For the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> say, that the Souls of the deceased do neither give a shadow, nor wink. Or is it that the Sun only makes a shadow, and the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids a Man to enter while the Sun shines? though this they speak aenigmatically, but verily he that goes in is called <hi>Elaphus</hi> [a Hart] Hence the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> delivered up <hi>Cantharion,</hi> the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to the <hi>Arcadians</hi> who went over to the <hi>Elians</hi> (whilst they waged War with the <hi>Arcadians</hi>) and passing with his booty through the inaccessible Temple fled to <hi>Sparta,</hi> when the War was ended, the Oracle requiring them to restore the Hart. <hi>[Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.]</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Was it because the <hi>Amazens</hi> flying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bacchus</hi> from the Coasts of <hi>Ephesus</hi> fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Samos,</hi> whereupon <hi>Bacchus</hi> rigging up his Ships, wafted over and joyning battle, slew abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them about that place which by reason of the plenty of blood spilt there, the beholders by way of admiration called it <hi>Panema,</hi> some say that this slaughter was about <hi>Plaeum</hi> and shew their Bones there but others say also that <hi>Plaeum</hi> was rent off from <hi>Samos,</hi> by the dreadful and heideous cry that was uttered at their death.</p>
               <p>Quest. 57. <hi>Ʋpon what account was</hi> Andron <hi>[the Name of a House] in</hi> Samos <hi>called</hi> Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The <hi>Geomorites [i. e.</hi> the <hi>Bores]</hi> got the Government into their hands, after <hi>Demoteles</hi> was slain and the dissolution of Monarchical constitution, the <hi>Megarines</hi> waged War with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nithites</hi> being a <hi>Samite</hi> Collony, and brought Fetters with them (as they say) to put on the Captives, when the <hi>Geomorites</hi> were acquainted with these procedings, they immediately sent Aid, setting forth nine Praefects, and managing thirty Ships, two of which Lanching forth and lying before the Haven was destroyed with Lightning, the Praefects proceeding on their Voyage in the rest subdued the <hi>Megarins,</hi> and took six hundred of them alive, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46331:138"/> were so elevated with this Victory, that they meditated the subversion of this <hi>Geomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Oligarchy,</hi> but the occasion was given by the States themselves, writing to them that they should bring the <hi>Megarine</hi> Captives bound in their own Fetters; when they received these Letters, they shewed them privately to the <hi>Megarines</hi> perswading them, to concur with them in a Conspiracy to procure the Peoples liberty, a Consult was held in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them about this matter, and the result was, that the best way was, to beat off the Rings from the Fetters, and put them on the <hi>Megarines</hi> and fasten them with Thongs to their Girdles that they might not fall off nor being loose should hinder them in their going. Accordingly they accoutred the Men in this manner, and giving each of them a Cimiter, they soon Sailed back to <hi>Samos</hi> and Landed, and accordingly led the <hi>Megarines</hi> through the Market-place to the Counsel-house, where all the <hi>Geomorites</hi> were sitting together, and then the sign being given the <hi>Megarines</hi> fell on and slew those Men, whereupon the City being set at liberty, they admitted the <hi>Megarines</hi> (as many as would) into the number of Citizens, and erecting a magnificent Edifice hung up the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in it.</p>
               <p>Quest. 58. <hi>What is the reason that the cheif Priest of</hi> Hercules <hi>in</hi> Antimachia <hi>at</hi> Coos, <hi>when he manageth the Sacrifice, is clothed in Womens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and wears a Mitre upon his head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Hercules</hi> setting Sail from <hi>Troy</hi> with six Ships, was attacked by a Storm, and lost all his Ships but one, with which only he was forced by the Wind upon the Coast of <hi>Coos,</hi> and fell
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46331:138"/> upon a place called <hi>Leceter</hi> saving nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Men and Armour. There hapning to meet with a flock of Sheep, he requested one Ram of the Shepherd (the Man was called <hi>Antagoras</hi>) who verily being a robust bodied young Man, challenged <hi>Heecules</hi> to fight with him, and if he were worsted <hi>Hercules</hi> should carry away the Ram. As soon as this fellow engaged with <hi>Hercules,</hi> the <hi>Meropes</hi> came into the aid of <hi>Antagoras,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians</hi> coming into assist <hi>Hercules</hi> a great Fight ensued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at (they say) <hi>Hercules</hi> overcharged with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, betook himself for refuge to a Woman called <hi>Tressa,</hi> where he was concealed, disguising himself in Womans Apparel. But afterwards conquering the <hi>Meropes,</hi> and passing under puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he Married the Daughter of <hi>Alciopus,</hi> and put on a Gown of flowred [Silk]. Hence the Priest offers Sacrifice in the place where the Battle was fought, but the Bridegrooms are cloathed in Womens Apparel when they embrace their Brides.</p>
               <p>Quest. 59. <hi>Whence was the race of</hi> Hamaxocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists <hi>in</hi> Megara?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In that licentious Democracy (which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the exaction of double Use and Sacriledge) the <hi>Peloponesians</hi> went on Pilgrimage to <hi>Delphos</hi> through the borders of <hi>Megara,</hi> and lodged in <hi>Aeigyra</hi> by the Lake side with their Wives and Children (as the case required) in their Caravans, where a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, drunken Company of the <hi>Megarins</hi> in a riotous and cruel manner overturned their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and overwhelmed them in the Lake; so that many of the <hi>Theori</hi> [Pilgrims] were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Megarins</hi> indeed by reason of the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Government neglected the punishment
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46331:139"/> of this wickedness, but the Amphyctions, taking into consideration the Devotion of this Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, punished the Actors of this Villany, some with Banishment, some with Death, thence the Posterity of these Villains were called <hi>Hamaxocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, i. e.</hi> overturners of Waggons.</p>

               <byline>Translated from the <hi>Greek,</hi> By <hi>Mr. Patrick</hi> of the <hi>Chaterhouse.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>
                  <hi>HIppomachus</hi> a Master of the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when some were commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tall Man that had long Hands, as one that promised fair to be good at Fisticuffs; replied, a fit Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the Victors Lawrel were to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up aloft, and should be his that could best reach it, and take it down: we may say the same to those that are transported with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of, and place their happiness in, having fair Fields, stately Mansion houses, and a great deal of Money lying by them; that they were in the right, <hi>if happiness were to be bought and sold.</hi> You may see indeed many Persons that chuse rather to be Rich, and at the same time very Miserable, than to part with their Money and become happy. But alas! indolency and repose of Spirit, magnanimity, constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46331:140"/> resolution, and contentment of Mind, these are not a Money-purchase. By having Wealth meerly, none can attain to a mean esteem of it, nor by possessing things superfluous, to a sense that we do not need them. From what other evils then can Riches free us, if not so much as from an inordinate desire of them? It's true indeed that by drinking Men allay their Thirst after drink, and by eating their longings after Food are satisfied, and he that said
<q>
                     <l>Bestow a Coat, of your good will</l>
                     <l>On <hi>Hipponax,</hi> that's cold and chill.</l>
                  </q> if more Cloaths had been heaped on than he needed, would have thrown them off, as being ill at ease. But the love of Money is not aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by having Silver and Gold, neither do cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desires cease, by possessing still more. But one may say to Wealth as he did to an insolent Quack.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thy Physick's nought and makes my illness worse,</l>
                  <l>My Body needs some ease, and not my Purse.</l>
               </q>
               <p>When this distemper seises a Man that wants only Bread and a House to put his head in, ordinary Raiment and such Victuals as come first to hand, it fills him with eager desires after Gold and Silver, Ivory and Emeralds, Hounds and Horses, thus taking off the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and carrying it from things that are necessary, after things that are troublesome and unusual, hard to come by and unprofitable when obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For no Man is poor, as to what Nature requires and what suffices it: No Man takes up
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46331:140"/> Money on use to buy Meal or Cheese, Bread or Olives; but you may see one Man run into Debt for the Purchase of a sumptuous House, another for an adjoyning Olive-yard, another for Corn-fields or Vineyards, another for <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Mules, and another by a vain expence.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For Horses fitly pair'd, with prancing feet</l>
                  <l>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to <hi>Homors</hi> Phrase, <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liad.</hi> 15.</note>To draw the ratling Chariot through the street,</l>
               </q>
               <p>has been plung'd over Head and Ears into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Use-Money, Pawns and Mortgages. Moreover, as they that use to drink after they have quenched their Thirst, and to eat after their hunger is satisfied, vomit up even what they took when they were a Thirst or Hungry; so they that covet things useless and superfluous, enjoy not even those that are necessary. This is the Character of these Men.</p>
               <p>As for those that spend nothing, although they possess much, and yet are always craving more, they may still more increase our wonder at their folly: especially when one calls to mind that of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who was wont to say, that when a Man did eat and drink liberally, and yet was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nearer being filled, in this case he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently goes to the Physitian, and enquires what's his Disease and his Indisposition, and how he may get rid of it. But if one that has five Beds desires ten, and having Ten Tables is for purchasing as many more, and having Land and Money good store, is not at all filled, but still is bent, even to the breaking his natural rest, upon getting more, and when he has never so much, never has enough, this Man thinks he has no need of a Physitian to cure him, and in order to it to show
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46331:141"/> him from what cause his distemper arises. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when a Man is a Thirst that hath not drunk at all, we expect that upon his drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thirstiness should cease; but as for him that drinks and drinks and so goes on without giving over, we do not think such a one needs further repletion but evacuation, and we advise him by all means to Vomit as knowing that his trouble proceeds nor from the want of any thing, but from some sharp Humour or preternatural heat that is within him.</p>
               <p>Among those persons therefore that are for increasing their substance, and getting more, he that is poor and indigent may perhaps give over his cares, when he has got a House, or found a Treasure, or by a Friends held has pay'd his Debts and has his Creditors discharge. But as for him that having more than enough, yet still desires to have more, it is not Gold nor Silver, not Horses, Sheep or Oxen, that can cure him of this Disease, but he needs Evacuation and Purgation: for his distemper is not penury and want, but an insatiable desire and thirst after Riches proceeding from a depraved and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate judgment of things, which if it be not plucked out of Mens Minds, like a thing twisting across and contracting them, they will always be in want of superfluities, that is, be craving things they have no need of.</p>
               <p>When a Physitian visits a Patient that has thrown himself upon his Bed, and lies here groaning and refusing to eat, he feels his Pulse and asks him some questions, and finding that he is not at all feverish, he tells him it's his Mind that is distempered, and goes his way. When we see therefore a Man pining away for more
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46331:141"/>
                  <hi>Means,</hi> and sighing sadly at any Expences, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing no sordid or painful course that brings him in gain, when yet he hath Houses and Lands, Herds and Slaves, and Cloaths enough, what shall we call this Mans Disease but <hi>Poverty of Mind?</hi> for as for <hi>want of Money,</hi> one friend, as <hi>Menander</hi> says, by being a Benefactor to him can cure it, but this other of the <hi>Mind,</hi> all a Mans friends living or dead cannot satisfie it. It was therefore a good saying of <hi>Solon,</hi> concerning such Persons.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Those Men, that after Wealth aspire,</l>
                  <l>Set no fix'd bounds to their desire.</l>
               </q>
               <p>To those indeed that are wise, the Riches that nature requires are limited, and like a Circle drawn from a Center at such a distance, is confined within the compass of their real needs.</p>
               <p>There is also this peculiar mischeif in the love of Wealth, that this desire hinders and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses its own satisfaction, which other desires do procure. For no Man abstains from a good Morsel because he loves Dainties, not from Wine because he thirsts after Wine, as these Men abstain from using Money, because they love Money. Does it not look like madness and a pitious Distemper, for a Man not to make use of a Garment because he shakes with cold, to refuse to eat Bread, because he is ready to famish with hunger, and not to use Wealth, because he is greedy of getting it?</p>
               <p>This is the evil case that <hi>Thrasonides</hi> describes,
<q rend="margQuotes">I have such a thing within by me, I have it in my power, and I <hi>will</hi> this thing, like those that are madly in Love, but <hi>I do</hi> it not: when
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46331:142"/> I have locked and sealed up all, or have told out so much to the Usurers and Tradesmen, I scrape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and hunt after more, I quarrel and contend with the Servants, the Plowmen and Debtors: O <hi>Apollo,</hi> hast thou ever seen a more wretched Man, or any Lover more miserable?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophocles</hi> being asked by one, whether he was able yet to company with a Woman; Heavens defend, said he, I have got my Liberty and by means of my old Age have escaped those mad and furious Masters: for it is very fit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, that when our <hi>pleasures</hi> leave us, <hi>those desires</hi> should do so too, which, as <hi>Alcaeus</hi> says,
<q>
                     <l>'Twas never any Mans good hap,</l>
                     <l>Nor Womens wholly to escape.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But it is otherwise in the Love of Wealth, which like a hard and severe Mistriss, compels us to get, what it forbids us to enjoy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites an Appetite, but denies the pleasure of its gratification. <hi>Stratonicus</hi> wittily abused the <hi>Rhodian</hi> for their profuseness, when he said, that they builded their Houses as if they were immortal, but provided for their Tables as if they were to live but a little while: so covetous Men seem to be profuse by what they possess, when they are sordid wretches if you consider what they use and enjoy; for they endure labour, but tast no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damades</hi> once came to <hi>Phocions</hi> house and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised him as he was at Dinner, and when he saw his frugal and slender Diet, I much wonder <hi>Phocion,</hi> says he, that you should manage State Affairs and can dine as you do: for this <hi>Orator</hi> himself, pleaded Causes and harangu'd the People
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46331:142"/> only for his Gut; and looking upon <hi>Athens</hi> as affording too little a supply for his Luxury, he fetch'd his Provisions from <hi>Macedonia:</hi> for which cause <hi>Antipater,</hi> seeing him when he was an old Man, compar'd him to a Sacrifice when all was over, and there remained nothing of the Beast but only the <hi>Tongue</hi> and the <hi>Stomach.</hi> But who would not wonder at thee, O wretched Man, who being able to live as thou dost, so sordidly, so unlike a Man, bestowing nothing on any Body, being currish to thy Friends, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ambition to serve the publick, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictest thy self and watchest whole Nights, hirest out thy Labours, lyest at catch for Inheritances, crouchest to every one, when thou art so well provided by thy sordid Parsimony to live at ease.</p>
               <p>It's reported of a certain <hi>Byzantine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some few words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low I have not Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, for there seems to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Greek, which makes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters cry out, that the reading is monstrous and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</note> that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing a Whore-Master with his Wife that was very hard favoured, he cryed out, O wretch, what compelled thee to do this, <hi>Sapagoras</hi> had a Portion with her? It's necessary for Kings, for Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators under them, for those that covet Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and Rule over Cities, that they should heap up Treasure; who are forced through Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Pride and Vain-glory to make Feasts, to gratifie Friends, to maintain a Retinue, to send Presents, to feed Armies, to purchase Gladiators. But thou hast so much business lying upon thy hand, tormentest thy self, tumblest up and down, and all this while livest the life of a Snail in thy Shell through Parsimony, and endurest all hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, receiving no advantage at all. Just like the Bath-keepers Asse, that carrys the Wood and Fewel for the Fires, and is always filled with the Smoak and Ashes of the Stove, but it self
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46331:143"/> is never bathed nor warmed, washed nor cleansed there.</p>
               <p>I have said enough of this sort of Covetousness, which makes a Man live the life of an <hi>Ass,</hi> or an <hi>Ant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another sort of it which is more Savage, that calumniates and gets inheritances by bad Arts, that pries into other Mens Affairs, that is full of thoughtfulness and cares, counting how many of their Friends are yet alive, and after all enjoy nothing of what by all these Arts they have heaped up.</p>
               <p>As therefore we have a greater aversion and hatred against the Vipers, poysonous Flies and Spiders, than against Bears and Lyons, because they kill and destroy Men, but serve themselves no farther of their Carkasses, which they do not feed upon as those other wild Beasts do; so they that become bad and ill Men through sordidness and parsimony, deserve more of our abhorrence, than those that prove such by luxurious living and excess; for they deprive others of what they are neither able nor inclin'd to make use of themselves.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Luxurious when they are rich and well provided, give some truce to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries; as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> said to some that were of opinion that <hi>Damades</hi> ceased to be an ill Man, now, says he, you see him full and glutted like the Lyons that then hunt not after prey. But as for the other, who in the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs propose no end to themselves either of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or profit, their covetous desires have no truce or cessation, they being always empty and standing in need of all things.</p>
               <p>But some perhaps may plead on their behalf, that these Men keep and hoard up their Wealth for their Children and Heirs; to whom they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46331:143"/> with nothing whilst they are alive, but like those Mice that live in Mines, and pick up and eat the Golden Sands and Oar, you cannot come by any of that Gold, till you anatomize them to find it after they are dead.</p>
               <p>But to what end, I pray, would they leave such a deal of Money and a great Estate to their Children and Heirs? that they forsooth may preserve it also for others, and those others in like manner should hand it down to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (just like those Earthen Pipes the Potters make for a Water-course, which retain none of the Water themselves, but one Pipe only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs it to the next) till some Informing false Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser or Tyrant appears, who cuts off this <hi>Keeper in Trust,</hi> and when his breath is stopped, derives and diverts the course of his Wealth into another Channel; or as they say till some one that is the most wicked of the Race, devours and consumes all, that those who went before him had preserved. For not only as <hi>Euripides,</hi> says,
<q>
                     <l>Children from Slaves deriv'd and baser blood,</l>
                     <l>Prove Prodigal and leud, none come to good.</l>
                  </q> but it's as true of the Children of the Parsimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; as <hi>Diogenes</hi> wittily abused this sort of Men, when he said, that it was better to be [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] a <hi>Ram</hi> than a Son of a Citizen of <hi>Megara.</hi> For under the pretence of training them up and instructing them, they undo and pervert them, implanting in them their own Love of Money and meanness of Spirit, and erecting as it were a Fortress for the securing their inheritance in the Minds of their Heirs.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:46331:144"/>
               <p>For the Instructions and Lessons they give them, are such as these, <hi>Gain as much and spend as little as may be: Value your self, according to what you are worth.</hi> But certainly this is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, but to contract and sow them up, just like a Purse, the better to conceal and keep what is put into it. The Purse indeed becomes foul and musty <hi>after</hi> the Money is put up in it; but the Children of the Covetous, <hi>before</hi> they are enriched by their Parents, are replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with covetous desires, which they derive from them. And indeed they pay them a deserved Reward for Instructions, not loving them because they shall receive a great Estate from them, but hating them, because they have it not so soon as they fain would. For being taught to admire nothing but Wealth, nor knowing any other end of living but to get a great Estate, they account the Life of their Parents to be an hinderance to that of their own, and fancy so much time is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from their own Age as is added to theirs. Wherefore whilst their Parents are yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, they secretly always steal their pleasures and injoy them, and what they bestow upon their Friends or spend upon their Lusts (when they have learnt something by secret information) is fetch'd as it were from anothers Estate, not their own.</p>
               <p>But when their Parents are dead, and they are once possess'd of their Keys and Seals, then their way of living is of another fashion, and they put on another Face and Aspect, grave, severe and morose. You hear no more of their former Pastimes in several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of the Ball, nor of the Academy or

               <p>But let us further consider, what is that use of Riches, for which Men so much admire them: is it the enjoyment of what suffices Nature?

               <p>The happiness Riches pretends to is such, that it depends upon spectators and witnesses, else it would signifie nothing at all. But it is quite otherwise when we consider Temperance or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy or such knowledge of the Gods as is requisite, though unknown to all other Mortals. This communicates a peculiar Light and great Splendor within the Soul, and causes a joy that dwells with it as an inmate, whilest it enjoys the chief good, though neither Gods nor Men were privy to it. Such a thing in truth is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and the Beauty of Geometrical and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Sciences. and does Riches with her Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Necklaces, and all that Gaudery that pleases Girls, deserve to be compared with any of these? When no body observes and looks on, Riches are truly blind and depriv'd of Light:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46331:146"/> For if a Rich Man makes a Meal with his Wife or Familiars alone, he makes no stir about Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Tables to eat on, or Golden Cups to drink in, but uses those that come next to hand; and his Wife without any Gold or Purple to adorn her, presents her self in a plain dress: but when he makes a Feast, that is, when the Pomp and Theater is to be fitted and prepared, and the Scene of Riches is to enter,

There is indeed a Praise of this kind which bears very excellent and lovely fruit, from whose seeds arise many of the same species very much meliorated, and improv'd. And therefore it is, that the wise Courtier seeks Glory, not as the reward or solace of his Vertue, not embraces it meerly as the Companion of his atchievements, but because the being accounted an Honourable Person, and Gallant Man, affords a Thousand opportunities of compassing many and more desireable things. For we see, those who are apt to believe, admire and love us, easily receive profit by us, with a great deal of delight; whereas if a Man lye under calumnies and suspicions, he cannot exert his Vertue to the benefit of others, without commiting a kind of violence upon them.</p>
               <p>There may also be more Reasons then these, which we must enquire into, that while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to avoid a frivolous and nauseous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding of our selves, we chance not to omi<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For as they who are ready to dye for Food, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst Nature are compelled to gnaw off their ow<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:46331:148"/> flesh, and thus put a miserable end to their Famine; so they, who mortally hunger after Praise, unless some one afford 'em a little scantlin Alms of commendation, do violate the Laws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, shamelesly endeavouring to supply those wants by an unnatural extolling of themselves.</p>
               <p>But when they do not on the bare consideration of themselves hunt applause, but strive to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the worth of others, by fighting against their Praises, and opposing their own works and practices to theirs, they add to their vanity an envious and abhorred baseness: and like him that thrusts his Foot into anothers dance, are stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd with a Proverb as ridiculous and pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Clowns.</p>
               <p>Therefore we must diligently beware that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Elogiums of others we foist not in any thing of our selves, which may seem jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously or enviously detractive from them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should we allow others to praise us at such a time, but frankly yield the Honour to those who are then celebrated, if their merit be real; and though the persons be vicious or unworthy, yet must we not take from them, by setting up our selves: but rather on the other hand reprove the unskilful applauders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate their encomiums to be improperly and dangerously conferr'd.</p>
               <q>'Tis plain that those Errors must be avoided.</q>
               <p>But self-praise is not lyable to disgrace or blame, when 'tis delicately handled by way of Apology to remove a calumny or accusation; Thus <hi>Pericles — but ye are angry at me, a Man inferiour to none, whether it be in the knowing or

Such Men as these will hardly be condemned, but those who should vote against them, are won over to their Cause, do receive infinite satisfaction, and are agreeably enspirited with this Noble boasting, especially if that bravery be steady, and the Ground firm on which it stands: This History does frequently discover; For when the <hi>Theban</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accused <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> that the time for their Government of <hi>Baeotia</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, they did not forthwith give up their Power, but made an Incursion into <hi>Laconia,</hi> and repaired, and repeopled <hi>Messene, Pelopidas</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself, and making many lowly entreaties, very hardly obtained his absolution: But <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundas</hi> loftily glorying in those Actions, and at last declaring he would willingly be put to Death, so that they would set up his Accusation, <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas hath wasted</hi> Laconia, <hi>an Enemies Country; hath prosperously settled the Affairs of</hi> Messene, <hi>and happily established the League and Alliance with</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia, <hi>against our wills,</hi> they admired him; and the Citizens wondring at the cheerful greatness of his courage, dismissed him with unspeakable pleasantness and satisfaction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Sthenelus</hi> had not been calumniated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but only patroniz'd his abused friend: and so the cause excus'd that freedom of Speech, which seem'd otherwise to have something of the <hi>Glorioso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Cicero</hi>'s magnifying his diligence and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Catalines</hi> Tryal, was not very pleasing to the <hi>Romans:</hi> yet when <hi>Scipio</hi> said <hi>they ought not to Judge</hi> Scipio, <hi>who had enstated them in the power of Judging all Men,</hi> they ascended Crown'd to the Capital and Sacrificed wirh him. For <hi>Scipio</hi> was not necessitated to this, but meerly spur'd by the desire of Glory; and the danger he was in delivered him from Envy.</p>
               <p>Now talking after an high and glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proves advantagious, not only to Persons in dangers of the Law, or such like imminent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, but to those also who are clouded in a dull series of misfortunes; and that more properly then when they appear splendid in the World. For what addition can words make to those who already seem possess'd of real glory, and to lie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging and basquing in her Beams? But those who at present are incapable of ambition, if they express themselves loftily, they seem only to bear up against the storms of Fortune, to undergird the greatness of their Souls, and to shun that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46331:150"/> pity and commiseration which supposes a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt and forlorn Condition. As therefore those who in walking affect a stiffness of Body and a stretcht out Neck, are accounted effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and foppish, but are commended if in fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and fighting they keep themselves erect and steady; so the Man grapling with ill Fortune, if he raise himself like a strong Champion to resist her, and by a bravery of Speech transform himself from abject and miserable to bold and noble, he is not to be censur'd as obstinate and audacious, but honour'd as invincible and great. Tho' <hi>Homer</hi> therefore described <hi>Patroclus</hi> in the happinesses of life, smooth, and without Envy, yet in death he makes him have something of the Bravo and a Soldiers gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant roughness.</p>

               <p>So <hi>Phocion,</hi> tho' otherwise very mild, after the Sentence pass'd on him, shew'd the greatness of his Mind in many respects; particularly to one of his fellow sufferers who miserably cry'd out and bewail'd his misfortune, <hi>What</hi> [says he] <hi>is it not a pleasure to thee to die with</hi> Phocion?</p>
               <p>Further a Prudent Man has not less, but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter liberty to speak any thing of himself, when his Merits are rewaraded with injurious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind returns, <hi>Achilles</hi> usually gave the Gods their Glory, and was moderate in such expressions, as
<q>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:46331:150"/>
                     <l>— If <hi>Jove</hi> shall grant me to destroy</l>
                     <l>This well wall'd Town. —'Tis <hi>Jove</hi> must ruin <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> But when he was unhandsomly reproach'd and aspers'd with contumelies, he added swelling words to his anger, and those in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause:
<q>
                     <l>I with my Ships twelve Cities overthrew;</l>
                     <l>Nor could they stand, tho' at a distant view,</l>
                     <l>My Helmets darting rays.—</l>
                  </q> For Apologies claim a great liberty of Speech, and boasting, as considerable Parts of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themistocles</hi> also, having neither been guilty of any thing distasteful in his words nor actions, yet perceiving the <hi>Athenians</hi> glutted with him, and beginning to neglect him, forbore not to say, <hi>Why, O ye happy people, do ye weary out your selves, by still receiving benefits from the same hands? Ʋpon every storm you fly to the same Tree, for shelter; yet when it is fair again despoil it of it's leaves, as you go away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They therefore who are injur'd usually recount their good actions to the ingrate: And if they also praise those excellencies which others are pleas'd to condemn, they are not only pardonable, but altogether without blame. For it is evident they reproach not others, but apologize for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>This gave <hi>Demosthenes</hi> a glorious freedom, yet allay'd the offensive brightness of his own praises, which almost every where shine through his whole Oration <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:46331:152"/> Embassies and Decrees, which were so much objected against him.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike this is the insinuating deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of an <hi>Antithesis;</hi> when a Person, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for any thing as a Crime, demonstrates it's opposite to be base and vicious. So <hi>Lycurgus</hi> being upbraided by the <hi>Athenians</hi> for stopping a Sycophants mouth with Money, <hi>and what kind of Citizens</hi> [says he] <hi>do you then take me to be, who having so long managed the Affairs of the Republick amongst you, am at last found rather to have given Money for the prevention of injustice, than to have receiv'd any thing to promote it?</hi> And <hi>Cicero, Metellus</hi> objecting he had cast more by his Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst 'em, than ever he had acquitted by his Pleading for 'em, replies, <hi>Who therefore will not freely declare, that</hi> Cicero <hi>has more honesty and faith than Eloquence?</hi> Many expressions of this nature are in <hi>Demosthenes;</hi> particularly, <hi>but who might not justly have slain me, if I had endeavoured in word only to sully what the City accounts lovely? Or what, think you, would those unworthy fellows have said, if, whilst I had been curiously poring on other things, the Citys had revolted?</hi> And all his foremention'd Oration ingeniously dresses these <hi>Antithetons</hi> and Solutions of Cases with the subtile Ornaments of his own praise. But this may very profitably be learn'd therein, that delicately tempr'ing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of his Auditors, with the things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himself, <hi>he secures himself from being lyable to Envy;</hi> nor becomes suspected of Self-love.</p>
               <p>There he relates in what manner the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> behav'd themselves to the <hi>Eubaeans,</hi> in what manner to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and what benefits they conferr'd upon those of <hi>Byzantium</hi> and <hi>Chersonesus;</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:46331:152"/> in all which he confesses his Part was only that of their Minister or Steward. Thus by a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical deceit he finely and insensibly instills his own praises into his hearers, who pleasingly hang upon his words, and rejoyce at the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those worthy deeds: Now this Joy is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately seconded by admiration, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is succeeded by a liking and love of that Person, who so wisely administred the Affairs. This <hi>Epaminondas</hi> seems to have consider'd, when being revil'd by <hi>Meneclidas</hi> as though he had an higher opinion of himself, then ever <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had, —<hi>if it be so [says he] O</hi> Thebans, <hi>'tis you have puff'd me up; you, by whose help alone, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>Empire in one day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since for the most part many are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly displeas'd with those who are the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters of their own Fame, but if they sound forth anothers are delighted, and give them cheerful acclamations; it is hence grown a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent custom amongst Orators by a seasonable extolling those who have like purposes, actions and manner of life with Theirs, to assure and wheedle over the Auditory to themselves; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though the <hi>Panegyrist</hi> solemnize ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worth, yet having the same endowments of Vertue, these Encomiums will redound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For as he who reproaches any Man for faults of which he himself is guilty, cannot but perceive he principally upbraids himself: So the vertuous by giving applauses to the vertuous, offer their own praises to the apprehensive, who will presently cry out, —<hi>and are not you one of these?</hi> Therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> honouring <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Androcopes</hi> again honouring <hi>Alexander,</hi> they in effect propos'd themselves to be in like manner
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46331:153"/> honoured by others. But <hi>Dionysius</hi> scoffing <hi>Gelon,</hi> and, calling him the <hi>Gelos</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was not aware through envy he had happen'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the greatness of his Authority and Power. These things the prudent Man must know and observe.</p>
               <p>Now those who are forc'd upon their own praises, are the more excusable, if they arrogate not the causes wholly to themselves, but ascribe them in part of Fortune, and in part to God. <hi>Achilles</hi> therefore said well,
<q>
                     <l>After the Gods of Conqu'ring him bestow'd</l>
                     <l>On me the Power.</l>
                  </q> and <hi>Timoleon</hi> did well, who Erected a <hi>Fane</hi> to Fortune, and dedicated his house to <hi>Bonus Genius,</hi> to whom he referr'd the felicity of his Attempts. But best of all <hi>Python Aenius,</hi> who after he had slain <hi>Cotys,</hi> coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> and perceiving that the Orators being very busie in applauding him to the People, displeas'd many, and stirr'd them up to Envy, he thus speaks, <hi>These things, ye</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>some of the Gods have done; our hands were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Instruments of their Work. Sylla</hi> also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented envy by his perpetually praising Fortune, not his prowess; and at last Sirnam'd himself <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> in acknowledgment that his success proceeded from the care of <hi>Venus.</hi> For the World will more readily impute whatever a Person has done well, to a lucky chance, or the pleasure of some God, then to his Vertue: and will hardly allow him any honour of a prosp'rous action; though all defects and misadventures they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute wholly to himself.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:46331:153"/>
               <p>The Laws therefore of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Locrenses</hi> with the more willingness and delight, because he had told 'em, <hi>Minerva</hi> constantly appear'd to him, dictated and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him in those Laws; and that they were none of them his own Inventions.</p>
               <p>These kind of excuses may be fram'd as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient remedies or preventions when we have to do with Persons of a difficult or envious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: nor is it amiss to use some little revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or corrections of what may seem spoken to our praise, even before those who are of a sedate and composed temper. If any commend us as those who have Learning, Riches, or Authority, we should hinder them from choosing such Topicks; and rather desire them, if they can, to take notice of us as innocent, good and useful. Thus we do not so much collate, as translate praises; and seem not to be puff'd up with our applauders, but rather to show they have not prais'd conveniently, and for truly meritorious things. We hide also inferior with better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications; yet not as desiring to be commended, but as teaching to commend aright. Such forms as these may be referr'd hither; <hi>'Tis true I have not wall'd the City with Stones or Brick; but if ye view my Fortifications you shall find Armour, and Horses, and Confederates enough.</hi> But more aptly belongs that of <hi>Pericles:</hi> when his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd him in the extreamities of death, they put him in mind of his Authority and the great Office he had discharg'd; as also what Victories, Trophies and Cities he had left the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but he raising himself a little, reprov'd them as fixing only upon common acquests, and enlarging rather in the Encomiums of Fortune than of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46331:154"/> Vertue; whereas they neglected the greatest matter and which was more peculiar to himself, <hi>That he had never been the occasion of any</hi> Athenians <hi>wearing black.</hi> And hence the Orator may learn if he be a good Man, to transfer the Eulogiums of his Eloquence to his vertuous Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the Commander who is admir'd and applauded for his conduct or happy Fortune in the Wars may freely propose his Clemency or Justice as more worthy to be prais'd. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it becomes even an Emperor upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of such glutting praises as Flatterers are commonly guilty of, to say something of this nature
<q>
                     <l>No God am I: Why do ye equal me</l>
                     <l>Thus to th' immortal Pow'rs;—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If you know me well let my justice or tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, my equanimity or humanity be rather spoken of. For even envy her self can easily concede the lesser honours to him who refuses the greater; nor will it rob any of true enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums, not to expect false and vain ones. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore several Princes wo permitted not themselves to be called Gods, nor the off-spring of the Gods, have yet assumed the Titles of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi, Philometores, Evergetae,</hi> or <hi>Theophili;</hi> and none ever doubted to honour them with those glorious yet human appellations.</p>
               <p>Again, they who in their Writings and Sayings are absolute Votaries to Wisdom by no means will be called <hi>Sophi</hi> or Wisemen, but can pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swallow the Epithet of Philosopher, <hi>i. e.</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or Lovers of Wisdom, or any other easie name which sounds not big, nor exposes them to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46331:154"/> envy; and so they beget and preserve a good esteem. But your Rhetorical Sophisters whilst in their Orations they gape for the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary acclamations of Divine, Angelical, Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, they loose even those common ones of Manly or Pretty well.</p>
               <p>Now as skilful Painters that they may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Eye, allay their overbright and gawdy colours by temp'ring 'em with darker; so there are some who will not represent their own Praises altogether glazing, and immoderately spendid, but cast in some defects, some scapes, or slight faults to take away the danger of displeasure or envy. <hi>Epeius</hi> intollerably brags
<q>I glory in my being much the best—</q> and after
<q>Ile crush my Adversaries Body, break his Bones,</q> yet he would seem to qualifie all with this
<q>I'st no enough that I'm in Fight unskill'd?</q> but, to say truth, to excuse his arrogance with so base a Confession is ridiculous. He then who would be an exact Man corrects himself for his forgetfulness, ignorance, ambition, or not giving ear to discipline or instructions. So does <hi>Ʋlys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>But I the Syrens much to hear desir'd;</l>
                  <l>With earnest brow my unwilling friends requir'd</l>
                  <l>To loose me from the Mast—</l>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:46331:155"/>
                  <l>None could perswade me, such the violent charm?</l>
                  <l>Such incentive to my pleasing harm!</l>
                  <l>But 't had been better far.—</l>
               </q>
               <p>And for the most part 'tis a good Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst envy to mix amongst our Praises those faults that are not altogether ungenerous and base: Therefore many temper them not only with confessions of Poverty or Unskilfulness, but even of vile descent. So <hi>Agathocles</hi> carowzing amongst the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Youth in Golden Bowls very curiously wrought, commanded Earthen Pots to be brought in, <hi>See</hi> (says he) <hi>what Diligence, Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes and Fortitude can do! Once we made muggen Jugs, but now Vessels of Gold.</hi> For his Original was so mean and contemptible, that it was thought he had serv'd in a Potters Shop, who at last go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd almost all <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the outward preventions, or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies against diseases that may rise from the speaking of ones self. There are some others inward which <hi>Cato</hi> has recourse to, when he tells us he was envy'd for neglecting his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Affairs, and being vigilant whole Nights in those of his Country,
<q>
                     <l>How shall I boast? who grow so easily</l>
                     <l>Tho' muster'd amongst the common Soldiery,</l>
                     <l>Great in my Fortune as the bravest he?</l>
                  </q> and
<q>
                     <l>But I am loth to loose past labours gains;</l>
                     <l>Nor will retreat form a fresh Troop of pains.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For as they who obtain great Possessions of Houses or Lands <hi>gratis,</hi> and with little difficulty,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46331:155"/> are under the Eye of Envy; but not if their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases were troublesome and dear; so it is with them who arrive at honour and applause. Well then, since 'tis evident, we may praise our selves not only inoffensively, and without being lyable to Envy, but with great advantage too; that we may not seem to do this for its self, but a further and better end, first consider whether it may prove for the Instruction of the Company by exciting them to a vertuous aemulation. For so <hi>Nestors</hi> relation of his own atchievements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed <hi>Patrochis,</hi> and nine others with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desire of single combat, and we know the Counsel that brings perswasive deeds as well as words, a lively exemplar, and an immediate familiar incentive, ensouls a Man with courage; moves, yea vehemently spurs him up to such a resolution of Mind as cannot doubt the possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and success of the attempt. This was the reason of that Chorus in <hi>Laecedemon</hi> consisting of Boys, Young-men and Old, which thus sung in Parts.</p>

Therefore a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and discreet Person must not set himself against the Praises of evil Men, but of evil actions, for they are not by any means to be applauded; and these kind of commendations pervert the judgments of Men, and miserably lead them to the imitating and aemulating unworthy practices as laudable. But they may be easily bewrayed by confronting them with opposite Truths. <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Tragedian is reported to have said to <hi>Satyrus</hi> the Comedian, <hi>'Tis not so wonderful an Art to move the Theaters Laughter, as to force its Tears,</hi> and if some Philosopher should have retorted, <hi>Ay, but friend 'tis not so fit and seemly to make Men weep, as to remove and free them from their Sorrow;</hi> 'tis likely by some odd way of commending himself, he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted his hearer, and endeavoured to alter or secure his Judgment.

               <p>This kind of Praise is amiable and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, teaching to admire and love convenient and profitable things, instead of the the superfluous and vain.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the stating of the question, in what cases, and how far self Praise may be inoffensive: Now the Order of the Discourse requires to shew how an uncomely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable affectation of Praise may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Discourse of a Mans self usually sallys from self Love, as from its Fort; and is there observed to lay wait, even in those who are vulgarly thought free enough from ambition. Therefore, as it is one of the Rules of health, to avoid dangerous and unwholsome places, or being in them to take the greater care, so it ought to be a like Rule concerning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and speaking of ones self. For this kind of Talk has slippery occasions, into which we unawares and indiscernibly are apt to fall.</p>
               <p>For first (as is abovesaid) ambition usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes with some flourishing remarks to adorn
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46331:158"/> her self: for let a Person be commended by his equal or inferior, the Mind of the Ambitious is tickled and rubed at the hearing of his Praise, and immediately he is hurried by an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate desire and precipitation after the like; as the Appetite of the hungry is sharpned by seeing others Eat.</p>
               <p>In the second place, the stroy of Mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Actions, naturally carrys them into the humour of boasting; and Joy so far transports them, that they swell with their own words, when they would give you a Relation of their Victorys, and success in the businesss of the State, or of other their publickly applauded Actions or Orations, they find it difficult not to play the Rhodomontado's, and preserve a mean. In which kind of Error 'tis observable that Soldiers and Mariners are most entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: nor is it unfrequent with those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Government of Provinces, and management of great Affairs. Such as these when is mention once made of Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Royal Personages, presently thrust in some Eulogys of themselves, as proceeding from the favour and kind opinion of those Princes; and then fancy they seem not at all to have prais'd themselves, but only given a bare account, what great Men have said hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of them. So, another sort, little different from these, think they are not discerned, when they tell you all the familiarities of Kings and Emperors with them, and their particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to recount them, not as thereby intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Honour, but as bringing in considerable Evidences of singular Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46331:158"/> and Humanity in Persons so excceding great.</p>
               <p>We see then what reason we have to look narrowly to our selves, that, whilst we confer praises on others, we give no ground for Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that we may make them but the vehicles of our own; and that <hi>in pretending to celebrate Patroclus</hi> under his name we mean Romantickly our selves.</p>
               <p>Further, that kind of discourse which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in dispraising and finding fault is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and yields opportunity to those that watch it, for the magnifying their own little worth. Of this old Men are inclinable to be guilty, when by chastizing and debasing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their Vices, they exalt themselves as wonderfully great in the opposite Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Indeed to these there must be a very large concession, if they be Reverend not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Age, but in Vertue and Place: For it is not altogether an unprofitable way, since it may sometimes create an extraordinary zeal, and aemulation of Honour in those who are thus spur'd up. But otherwise that sort of humour is carefully to be shun'd; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is often bitter, and wants a great deal of caution to sweeten and correct it. Now this is not done by the tempering our own Praises with the reprehension of another: for he is an unworthy and odious Fellow, who seeks his own Credit through any Mans disgrace, basely endeavouring to build a slight Reputation of his Vertue, upon the discovery of anothers crimes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as they who are naturally enclin'd to a dangerous sort of Laughter, which is a kind of a violent passion or disease, must preserve
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46331:159"/> especially the smooth Parts of the Body from tickling incentives that may provoke it: So they whose Minds are soft, and propense to the desires of Reputation, must carefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they be not precipitated by the ticklings of anothers Praises into a vaporing of themselves. They ought rather to blush, if they hear themselves commended; and not put on a brazen face. They ought modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and handsomly to reprove tieir applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as having honour'd them too much; and not chide them for having been too spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their Praise. Yet in this many offend, putting those who speak advantagiously of them in mind of more things of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; endeavouring to make a huge heap of creditable actions, till they spoil not only what they themselves added, but all that their Friends conferr'd to the promoting their esteem.</p>
               <p>Some there are who flatter themselves till they are stupidly puff'd up: others alure a Man to talk of himself, and take him, by casting some little gilded temptation in his way: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> another sort for a little sport will be putting que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, as those in <hi>Menander</hi> to the silly <hi>Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> Soldier.</p>

                  <l>For Heav'ns sake, how?</l>
                  <l>As from my Scaling Ladder</l>
                  <l>I mounted the pround Wall. See here! behold!</l>
                  <l>

               </q>
               <p>But they spoil'd all with Laughter.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:46331:159"/>
               <p>We must therefore be watchful that we neither our selves drop into our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Praises; nor he hooked into them by others. Now the best and most certain way of Security is to look back upon such as we can remember guilty of this fault; and consider how absurd and ugly it is accounted by all Men; and that hardly any thing is in converse a greater disturbance then this.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that though there be no other quality in such persons unpleasing, yet as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had taught us to abhor and fly it, we hasten out to get a little fresh Air, and even the very Parasites and indigent Flatterers are uneasie, when the wealthy and great Men, by whose scraps they live, begin to admire and extol themselves. Yet [they say] these are the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal dishes at Feasts; Therefore he in <hi>Menander</hi> crys out
<q>
                     <l>They kill me, I'm a macerated Guest</l>
                     <l>With their wise saying and their Souldiers brags.</l>
                     <l>How base these Glorioso's are!—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But these faults are not only to be objected against common Soldiers and Upstarts, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others with gaudy and proud relations of their own actions; but also to Sophists and Philosophers and Commanders, growing full of themselves, and talking at a fastuous rate.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis fit we still remember that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers dispraise always accompanys the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet Praises of our selves. That the end of vain glory is disgrace, and that as <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi> tells us, the Company will both be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46331:160"/> and judge otherwise of us, then we would seem to be. Let us then forbear to talk of our selves, unless the profit that we or others may thence probably reap, be considerably great.</p>

Then taking all Three, he blended them into one form, forcibly adapting to the <hi>Same,</hi> the Nature of the <hi>Other,</hi> not readily condescending to a Mixture.

Nor does either of the two Conjectures require many Words of Explanation. In regard the one side pretends, that by the Mixture of the Divisible and Indivisible Substance no other thing

But the <hi>Same</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> being blended together, of which, this is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Motion and Mutation, the t'other of Rest and Stability; from these two springs the Soul, which is no less Active or Passive it self, to stay, or to be stay'd, to move, or to be mov'd.</p>
               <p>But the Followers of <hi>Crantor,</hi> supposing the proper Function of the Soul to consist in judging of those things which are discernable to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and liable to Sense, as also of the Differences and Similitudes of these things, as well in themselves, as in reference one to another, alledge the Soul to be compos'd of All, to the end she may have a true Knowledge of the whole: Now the things of which she is to make her Judgment, are fourfold; The Intelligible Nature always immutable and still the same: The Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nature, which is Passive and subject to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the Nature of the <hi>Same;</hi> and the Nature of the <hi>Other,</hi> or the <hi>Diversly Opposite;</hi> in regard the two former in some measure participate also of <hi>Diversity</hi> and <hi>Identity.</hi> All these Philosophers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise equally hold, that the Soul does neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Beginning from Time, nor that it is the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46331:162"/> Product of Generation; but that it is endu'd with several Faculties and Vertues into which <hi>Plato,</hi> as it were melting and dissolving its Substance for Contemplation's Sake, supposes it, only in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to have had its Original from Procreation and Mixture.</p>
               <p>The same was his Opinion concerning the World; for he knew it to be created, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning; but not perceiving it so easie to apprehend how the Structure was rear'd, or by what Order and Government supported, unless by admitting its Beginning and the Causes thereto concurring, he follow'd that Method to instruct himself. These things being thus generally by them laid down, <hi>Eudorus</hi> will allow to neither side any share of probability: and indeed to me, they both seem to have wander'd from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Plato;</hi> if we intend to make the most likely Rule our Guide; which is not to advance our own Conceits, but to come as close as we can to his Sence and Meaning. Now as to this same Mixture, as they call it; of the intelligible and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Substance, there is no reason appears, why it should be more the Original of the Soul, than of any other thing that ye can name. For the whole World it self, and every one of its parts pretend to no other Composition than of a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Intelligible Substance. Of which the one affords Matter and Foundation, the other Form and Figure to the whole Mass. And then again, whate're there is of material Substance fram'd and structur'd by participation and assimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the intelligible Nature, is not only to be felt, but visible to the Eye; when as the Soul still soars above the reach of all natural Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Neither did <hi>Plato</hi> ever assert <hi>Number</hi> to the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46331:162"/> Soul, but a perpetually self-moving Nature, the Fountain and Principle of Motion. Only he embellish'd and adorn'd the Substance of it with Number, Proportion and Harmony; as being a Subject capable of receiving the most goodly form which those Ornaments could produce. So that I cannot believe it to be the same thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Soul according to Number, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Soul to be <hi>Number</hi> it self. Nor can it be said to be Harmony, because harmoniously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as he has clearly demonstrated in his Treatise of the Soul. But plain it is, that those Philosophers understood not the meaning of <hi>The Same,</hi> and the <hi>Other.</hi> For they tell us how the <hi>Same</hi> contributes Rest, the <hi>Other</hi> Motion toward the Generation of the Soul. Though <hi>Plato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in his Treatise entitl'd the <hi>Sophist;</hi> disposes and distinguishes Essence, <hi>The Same, The Other,</hi> together with <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> as being fine Things altogether differing one from another; and void of mutual Affinity. But these Men are generally, as the most part of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Readers, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morously and vainly perplex'd, use all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors by wresting and tormenting his Sence, to conceal and hide what he has written, as if it were some terrible Novelty not fit for publick View, that the World and the Soul had not their Beginning and Composition from Eternity, and therefore were not confin'd within the boundless immensity of Time for the future: of which we have particularly spoken already. So that now it shall suffice to say no more than this, that these Writers confound and smoother, if they do not rather utterly abolish his eager Contest and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in behalf of the Gods, wherein <hi>Plato</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses himself to have been transported with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46331:163"/> Zeal, even beyond the Strength of his Years, against the Atheists of his Time. For if the World had no beginning, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes; That the Soul, much elder than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the Principle of all Motion and Alteration, or to use his own Words, their Chieftain and first efficient Cause, whose Mansion is in Nature's most secret Retirement. But what the Soul is, what the Body, and why the Soul is said to have been elder than the Body, shall be made appear in the Progress of this Discourse. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of which seems to have been the Occasion of so much Doubt and Incredulity, in reference to the true Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Therefore I shall propose my own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents concerning these things, desiring to gain Credit no otherwise than by the most probable strength of Arguments, explaining and reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the utmost of my Ability, Truth and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox together: after which I shall apply both the Explication and Demonstration to the Words of the Text. In my Opinion then, the Business lies thus: The World, saith <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> neither did any one of all the Gods, nor any mortal Man create. As if he had been afraid, that not being able to make out the Creation by a Deity; we should be constrain'd to acknowledge some Man to have been the Architect of the Universe. But certainly far better it is in submission to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Judgment, both to avow, and in our Songs of Praise to attribute the Glory of the Structure to God. For the Frame it self is the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of all Master-pieces, and God the most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious of all Causes: But that the Substance and Materials were not created, but always ready at the ordering and disposal of the Omnipotent Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46331:163"/> to give it Form and Figure, as near as might be approaching to his own Resemblance. For the Creation was not out of nothing, but out of Matter wanting Beauty and Perfection, like the rude Materials of a House, a Garment, or a Statue, lying first in shapeless Confusion. For before the Creation of the World, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a confus'd Heap: Yet was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Heap neither without a Body, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor without a Soul. The Corporeal part was without Form or Consistence, and the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part stupid and headlong without reason or Conduct. God neither incorporated that which was incorporeal, nor conveigh'd a Soul into that which had none before; like a Person either Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical or Poetical, who does not make the Voice, nor the Movement, only he renders the Voice Harmony, and graces the Movement with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Measures. Thus God did not make the Tangible and Repercutient Solidity of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance; nor the imaginative or moving Faculties of the Soul. But taking these two Principles, as they lay ready at hand, the one obscure and dark, the other turbulent and sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, both imperfect without the Bounds of Order and Decency, He so dispos'd, digested, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish'd the confus'd Mass, that He brought to perfection a most absolute and glorious Creature. Therefore the Substance of the Body is no other; then that all receiving Nature, the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Nurse</hi> of all created Beings. But the Substance of the Soul in <hi>Philebus</hi> he called an infinite, being the Privation of Number and Proportion; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Period nor Measure either of Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution or Excess, of Distinction or Dissimilitude. But as to that Order he alledges in <hi>Timaeus,</hi> to be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46331:164"/> the mixture of Nature with the indivisible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but being apply'd to Bodies, becomes lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Division, he would not have it thought to be a Bulk augmented by Unites or Points, nor by Longitude and Breadth, which are Qualities more consentaneous to Bodies than to the Soul, but that disorderly unlimited Principle, moving both it self and other Substances, that which he frequently calls Necessity, and within his Treatise of Laws, he openly stiles the disorderly ill acting, or harm-doing Soul. For such was this Soul of her self, but at length one became wise, that by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Understanding, Ratiocination and Harmony, she might be the Soul of the World: Thus that All-receiving and material Principle, enjoy'd both Magnitude, Space and Distance; but Beauty, Form and Measure of Proportion it had none. However all these it obtain'd, when it came to be embellish'd and adorn'd with all the Ornaments of Sea and Land, the Heavens, the Stars, and all those infinite Varieties of Plants and living Creatures. Now as for those who attribute to <hi>Matter;</hi> and not to the Soul, that which in <hi>Timaeus</hi> is call'd <hi>Necessity,</hi> in <hi>Philebus, vast Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion and unlimited Exorbitancy</hi> of <hi>Diminution</hi> and <hi>Excess,</hi> they can never maintain it to be the Cause of Disorder, in regard that <hi>Plato</hi> always al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that same Matter to be without any Form or Figures, and altogether destitute of any Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or effectual Vertue properly belonging to it; comparing it to such Oyls that have no Scent at all, which the Perfumers mix in their Tictures. For there is no likelihood that <hi>Plato</hi> would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that to be the Cause and Principle of Evil, which is altogether feneant in it self, sluggish, and never to be rous'd on to Action; and yet
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46331:164"/> at the same time brand this <hi>Immensity</hi> with the harsh Epithete of deformed and mischievous, and call it <hi>Necessity</hi> repugnant and contumatiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious against God. For this same <hi>Necessity,</hi> which ranverses Heaven (to use his own Phrase in his Politicks) and turns it the quite contrary way from Decency and Symmetry, together with, innate Concupiscence, and that inbred Confusion of ancient Nature, hurly burly'd with all manner of Disorder, before they were wrought and kneaded into the graceful <hi>Decorum</hi> of the World, whence came they to be conveighed into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Varieties of Forms and Beings, if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is the <hi>First Matter,</hi> were void of all Quality whatsoever, and depriv'd of all efficient Cause; more especially the Architect being so good himself, and intending a Frame the nearest approaching to his own Perfections? For besides these, there is no third Principle. And indeed we should stumble into the perplex'd Intricacies of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> should we advance Evil into the World out of Non-entity, without either any preceding Cause or Effect of Generation; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that among those Principles that have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not probable, that either real Good, or that which is destitute of all manner of Quality, should afford Birth or Substance to Evil. But <hi>Plato</hi> escap'd those Pit-falls into which they blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred who came after him; who neglecting what he carefully embrac'd, the third Principle, and energetick Vertue, in the middle betwixt God and the first Matter, maintain the most absurd of Arguments, affirming the Nature of Evils to have crept in spontaneously and adventitiously, I know not how, nor by what strange Accidents. And yet they will not allow an Atome of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:46331:165"/> so much as a moments Liberty to shift in its Station, which, as they say, would infer Motion out of Non-entity, without any impulsive Cause; nevertheless, themselves presuming all this while to affirm, that Vice and Wickedness, together with a thousand other Incongruities and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afflicting the Body, of which no Cause can be ascrib'd to any of the Principles, deriv'd their Being from Consequence. <hi>Plato</hi> however does not so, who despoiling the first Matter of all manner of Distinction, and separating from God, as far as it is possible, the Causes of Evil, has thus deliver'd himself concerning the World in his Political Discourses. <hi>The World,</hi> saith he, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the illustrious Builder all things beautiful and lovely; but whatsoever happens to be noxious and irregular in Heaven, through its exterior Habit and Disposition, from thence it derives those Inconveniences, and conveighs them into the several Creatures.</hi> And a little after, in the same Treatise, <hi>In process of time, when Oblivion had incroach'd upon the World, the Distemper of its ancient Confusion more prevail'd, and the Hazard is, lest being dissolv'd, it should again be sunk and plung'd into the immense Abyss of its former Irregularity.</hi> But there can be no dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the first Matter, as being void of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Distinction.</p>
               <p>Of which, when <hi>Eudemus,</hi> with several others, was altogether ignorant, he seems deridingly to cavil with <hi>Plato,</hi> and taxes him with asserting the first Matter to be the Cause, the Root and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Evil, which he had at other times so frequently dignify'd with the tender Appellations of <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurse.</hi> Whereas <hi>Plato</hi> gives to Matter only the Titles of the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurse;</hi> but the Cause of Evil he makes to be the moving
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46331:165"/> Force residing within it, not govern'd by Order and Reason, though not without a Soul neither, which in his Treatise of the Laws, he calls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly the Soul repugnant, and in Hostility with that other propitiously and kindly acting. For though the Soul be the Principle of Motion, yet is it the Understanding and Intelligence which measures that Motion by Order and Harmony, and is the Cause of both. God therefore did not wake a sluggish and sleepy Matter into Action, but prevented it by a fix'd Establishment from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer troubled and disquieted by a sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and stupid Cause. Neither did he infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature the Principles of Alteration and passive Subjection to Disorders; but when it was under the Pressure of those unruly Disorders and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he discharg'd it of its manifold Enormities and Irregularities, making use of Symmetry, Proportion and Number, as the most proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, not of Alteration and lawless Motion to distract the several Beings with Passions and Distinctions, but rather to render 'em fix'd and stable, and nearest in their Composition to those things that in themselves continue still the same upon the equal Poise of Diuturnity. And this in my Judgment is the Sence and Meaning of <hi>Plato.</hi> Of which, the easie Reconciliation of his seeming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities and Contradiction of himself may serve for the first Proof.</p>
               <p>For indeed no Men of Judgment would have objected to the most <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Sophisters, more especially to <hi>Plato,</hi> the Guilt of so much Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and impudent Rashness in a Discourse by him so elaborately study'd, as to affirm the same Nature in one place never to have been created, in another to have been the Effects of Generation
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46331:166"/> in <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> to assert the Soul Eternal: in <hi>Timaeus,</hi> to subject it to Procreation. The Words in <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> need no Repetition, as being generally fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Learned, wherein he proves the Soul to be incorruptible, in regard it never had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; as being that which moves it self. But in <hi>Timaeus, God,</hi> saith he, <hi>did make the Soul a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to the Body, as now we labour to prove it to have been subsequent to the Body.</hi> For he would have never suffer'd the more Ancient, because link'd and coupl'd with the Younger, to have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by it; only We, guided I know not how, by Chance and inconsiderate Rashness, frame odd kind of Notions to our selves. But God most certainly compos'd the Soul excelling the Body in Seniority both of Original and Power to be Mistriss and Governess of her inferior Servant. And then again he adds, how that the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to her self, began the Divine Beginning of an eternal and prudent Life. <hi>Now,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Body of Heaven became visible; but the Soul being invisible, nevertheless participating of Ratiocination and Harmony, by the best of intelligible Beings, she was made the best of things created.</hi> Here then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines God to be the best of sempiternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Soul to be the most excellent of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral existences. By which apparent Distinction, and <hi>Antithesis,</hi> he denies the Eternity of the Soul, or that it never had a Beginning. And thus what other or better Reconciliation of these seeming Contrarieties, than his own Explanation, to those that are willing to apprehend it. For he declares to have been without beginning the never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Soul that mov'd all things confusedly and in an irregular manner before the Creation of the World. But as for that, which God compos'd
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46331:166"/> out of this, and that other permanent and choicest Substance both prudent and orderly, and adding of his own, as if it were for Form and Beauty's sake, Intellect to Sence, and Order to Motion, constituted Prince and Chieftain of the whole, that he acknowledges to have had a Beginning and to have proceeded from Generation. Thus he likewise pronounces the Body of the World in one respect to be eternal and without Beginning, in another Sence to be the Work of the Creation. To which purpose, where he says that the visible Structure, never in repose at first, but restless in a confus'd and tempestuous Motion, was at length by the hand of God, dispos'd and rang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Majestick Order, where he says that the four Elements, Fire and Water, Earth and Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the stately Pile was by them embellish'd and adorn'd, caus'd a prodigious Fever, and shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ague in the whole Mass of Matter, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under the Combats of their unequal Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by his urging these things he gives those Bodies room in the vast Abyss before the Fabrick of the Universe. Again, when he says, that the Body was younger than the Soul, and that the World was created, as being of a Corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that may be seen and felt, which sort of substances must necessarily have a Beginning and be created; it is evidently demonstrable from thence, that he ascribes Original Creation to the Nature of Bodies. So far is he from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant or contradictory to himself in these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest Mysteries. For he does not contend, that the same Body was created by God, or after the same manner, and yet that it was before it had a Being, which would have been to act the part of a Jugler; but he instructs us what we ought to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46331:167"/> understand by Generation and Creation. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> says he, <hi>at first all these things were void of Measure and Proportion; but when God first began to beautifie the whole, the Fire and Water, Earth and Air, having perhaps some Prints and Footsteps of their Forms, lay in a huddle jumbl'd together, as probable it is, that all things are, where God is absent, which then he reduc'd to a comely Perfection, vary'd by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Order.</hi> Moreover, having told us before, that it was not a Work of one, but of a twofold Proportion to bind and fasten the bulkie Immensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole, which was both solid and of a prodigious profundity, and then coming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how God, after he had plac'd the Water and the Earth in the midst between the Fire and the Air, incontinently clos'd up the Heavens into a circular Form. <hi>Out of these Materials,</hi> saith he, <hi>being four in number, was the Body of the World created, agreeing in Proportion, and so amicably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding together, that being thus embody'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within their proper Bounds, it is impossible that any dissolution should happen from their own Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force, unless He that riveted the whole Frame, should go about again to rend it in pieces:</hi> most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently teaching us, that God was not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and Architect of the Corporeal Substance only, or of the Bulk and Matter, but of the Beauty, the Symmetry and Similitude that adorn'd and grac'd the whole. The same we are to believe He thought concerning the Soul; that there is one which was neither the Created by God, neither is it the Soul of the World, but a certain self-moving and restless Efficacy of a giddy, headstrong, irrational and disorderly Agitation and Impetuosity. The other, that which God himself having accouter'd and adorn'd with sutable
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46331:167"/> Numbers and Proportions, has made Queen: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the created World, her self the Product of Creation also. Now that <hi>Plato</hi> had this Belief concerning these things, and not for Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Sake laid down these Suppositions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creation of the World and the Soul, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others, seem to be an evident signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that as to the Soul, he avers it to be both created and not created, but as to the World he always maintains, that it had a Beginning, and was created, never that it was Incorruptible and Eternal. What Necessity therefore of bringing any Testimonies out of <hi>Timaeus.</hi> For the whole Treatise from the Beginning to the End, discourses of nothing else but of the Creation of the World. As for the rest we find that <hi>Timaeus</hi> in his <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> addressing himself in Prayer to the Deity, calls God that Being which of old existed in his Works, but now was apparent to Reason. In his Politicks, his <hi>Parmenidean</hi> Guest acknowledges the World, which was the Handy-work of God, to be replenish'd with several good things, and that if there be any thing in it which is vitious and offensive, that it is a Mixture of its first ill Habit of <hi>Incongruous</hi> and <hi>Irrational.</hi> But <hi>Socrates,</hi> in his Politicks, beginning to discourse of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which some call by the Name of <hi>Wedlock; The Created Divinity,</hi> saith he, <hi>has a circular Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, which is, as it were, enchas'd and involv'd in a certain and perfect Number; meaning in that place by created Divinity no other than the World it self.</hi> The first Pair of these Numbers consists of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two,</hi> the second of <hi>Three</hi> and

Then <hi>Five</hi> and <hi>Thirty</hi> they nam'd Harmony, as consisting of the two first Cubes, rising from an odd and an even Number; as also out of the four Numbers <hi>Six, Eight, Nine</hi> and <hi>Twelve</hi> comprehending both Harmonical and Arithmetical Proportion. Which nevertheless will be more conspicuous being made out in a Scheme to the Eye.</p>
                  <p>Admit a Right Angle Parallellogram, <gap reason="math">

Let the lesser Division be unequally divided into two and three Squares, mark'd E.

F.G.C.H. eight, and GIHD. twelve. By this means the whole Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lellogram containing thirty five little square A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas, comprehends all the Proportions of the first concords in Musick in the number of these little Squares. For six is exceeded by eight in a <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce</hi> proportion, wherein the <hi>Diatessaron</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And six is exceeded by nine, in a <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quialter</hi> proportion, wherein is also included the fifth. Six is exceeded by Twelve in duple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, containing also the <hi>Octave;</hi> and then
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46331:169"/> lastly, there is the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> Proportion of a Tone in eight to nine. And therefore they call that Number which comprehends all these Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Harmony. This Number is 35, which being multiply'd by 6, the Product is 120. Which is the Number of Days, they say, which brings those Infants to Perfection that are born at the seven Months end. To proceed by way of Multiplication, twice 3 makes 6. And four times 9 thirty six, and 8 times 27 produces 216. Thus 6 appears to be a perfect Number, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to its Parts, and therefore called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,</hi> by reason of the Mixture of the first Even and Odd. Moreover, it is compos'd of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Number, which is <hi>One,</hi> of the first even Number, which is <hi>Two,</hi> and the first odd Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is <hi>Three.</hi> Then for 36, it is the first, as well Quadrangular as Triangular Number. Quadrangular from 6, and Triangular form 8. The same thing happens from the Multiplication of the two first square Numbers, 4 and 9, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from the Addition of the three Cubical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>One, Eight,</hi> and 27, which being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up 36. Lastly, you have the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual sides of the Parellellogram, by the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of 12 by 3, or 9 by 4.</p>
                  <p>Take then the Numbers of the sides of all these Figures, the 6 of the Square, the 8 of the Triangle, the 9 for the one side of the Parallello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, and the 12 for the other side, and there you will find the Proportions of all the Concords. For 12 to 9 will be a <hi>Fourth,</hi> as <hi>De la sol re</hi> to <hi>A la mire</hi> below. To 8 it will prove a <hi>Fifth,</hi> as <hi>De la sol re</hi> to <hi>G sol re ut</hi> below. To six it will be an <hi>Octave,</hi> as <hi>D la sol re</hi> to <hi>D solre.</hi> And the two hundred and sixteen is the Cubical Number, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46331:169"/> from six, which is its Root, and so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual from the <hi>Senarie</hi> to its own <hi>Perimeter.</hi> Now these Numbers aforesaid being endu'd with all these Properties, the last of them, which is 27, has this peculiar to it self, that being added, to those that preceded, it is equal to All together; besides that, it is the Periodical Number of the Days wherein the <hi>Moon</hi> finishes her monthly Course, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> make it to be the Limit of all Harmonical Intervals. On the other side, they call Thirteen the <hi>Remainder,</hi> in regard it misses a Unite to be half of Seven. Now that these Numbers comprehends the Proportions of Harmoniacal Concord, is easily made apparent. For the Proportion of 2 to 1 is duple, which contains the <hi>Diapason;</hi> as the Proportion of 2 to 3 <hi>Sesquialter;</hi> which embraces the <hi>Fifth:</hi> and the Proportion of 4 to 3 <hi>Sesquiterce,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the <hi>Diatessaron.</hi> The Proportion of nine to three <hi>Triple,</hi> including the <hi>Diatessaron</hi> and <hi>Diapente,</hi> and that of 8 to 2 <hi>Quadruple,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the double <hi>Diapason.</hi> Lastly, there is the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> in 8 to 9, which makes the <hi>Tone Major,</hi> counting then the Unite which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as well to the even as the odd Numbers, the whole Series of Figures compleats the Decad. For the first four Numbers from the Unite, 1, 2, 3, 4, make <hi>Ten:</hi> and these even Numbers, 1, 2, 4, 8, produce 15, in order the third Triangular or Trigonal Number from <hi>Five.</hi> On the other side, take the odd Numbers, 1, 3, 9, and add to them 27, the product is 40, by which Numbers the Skilful measure all musical Intervals, of which they call'd the one a <hi>Diesis</hi> (or the half of a <hi>Semitone Minor</hi>) and the other a <hi>Tone.</hi> Which Number of 40 proceeds
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46331:170"/> from the force of the <hi>Quaternary</hi> Number by Multiplication. For from the first four Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, every one being multiply'd four times by it self, the Product will be 4, 8, 12, 16, which being added altogether make 40, comprehending all the Proportions of Harmony. For 16 is a <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> to 12, Duple to 8, and Quadruple to 4. Again, 12 holds a <hi>Sesquialiter</hi> proportion to 8, and Triple to 4. In which proportions are contain'd the Intervals of the <hi>Diatessaron, Diapente, Diapason,</hi> and double <hi>Diapason.</hi> Moreover, the Number 40 is equal to the two first <hi>Tetragones,</hi> and the two first Cubes being taken both together. For the first <hi>Tetragones</hi> are 1 and 4, the first Cubes are 12 and 27, which being added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make 40. Whence it appears that the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic Quaternary,</hi> is much more perfect and fuller of Variety than the <hi>Pythagoric;</hi> but in regard the Numbers propos'd did not afford space sufficient for the middle Intervals, therefore there was a Necessity to allow larger Bounds for the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And now we are to tell ye what those Bounds and middle Spaces are. And first concerning the <hi>Medieties;</hi> of which, that which equally exceeds and is exceeded by the same Number, is call'd <hi>Arithmetical;</hi> the other which exceeds, or is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the same part of its Extremities, is call'd <hi>Subcontrary.</hi> Now the Extreams, and the middle of <hi>Arithmetical Mediety</hi> are 6, 9, 12. For 6 is exceeded by 9, as nine is exceeded by 12, that is to say, by the Number three. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of the <hi>Subcontrary</hi> are 6. The Extreams and middle of the <hi>Subcontrary</hi> are 6, 8, 12, where 6 is exceeded two by 8, and 8 four by 12, yet 2 is equally the Third of 6, as 4 is the third
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46331:170"/> part of 12. So that in the <hi>Arithmetical Mediety,</hi> the Middle exceeds and is exceeded by the same part; but in the <hi>Subcontrary Mediety,</hi> one of the Extreams wants, the other abounds in the same part of the Extremity, for in the first, 3 is the third part of the <hi>Medium</hi> in reference to both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; but in the latter, the third parts are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, 4 and 2, whence it is call'd <hi>Subcontrary.</hi> This they also call Harmony, as being that whose Middle and Extreams afford the first Concords: that is to say, between the highest and lowermost lies the <hi>Diapason:</hi> between the highest and the middle lies the <hi>Diapente;</hi> and between the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and lowermost lies the <hi>Fourth</hi> or <hi>Diatessaron.</hi> For suppose the higest Extream to be <hi>D la sol re,</hi> and the lowest Extream <hi>De sol re,</hi> the middle is <hi>G sol re ut,</hi> making a <hi>Fifth</hi> to the uppermost Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, but a <hi>Fourth</hi> to the lowermost. So that <hi>D la sol re</hi> answers to 12, <hi>G sol re ut</hi> to 8, and <hi>D sol re</hi> to 6. Now the more readily to find out these <hi>Mediums, Eudorus</hi> hath taught us an easie Method. For after you have propos'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, if you take the half part of each, and add them together, the Product shall be the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle alike both in Duple and Triple Proportions, in <hi>Arithmetical Mediety.</hi> But as for <hi>Subcontrary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> in duple proportion, first having fix'd the Extreams, take the third part of the lesser, and the half of the larger Extream, and the Addition of both together shall be the middle. In triple proportion the half of the lesser, and the third part of the larger Extream shall be the <hi>Mediety.</hi> As for Example, in triple proportion let 6 be the least Extream, and 18 the biggest; if you take 3, which is the half of 6, and 6 which is the third part of 18, the Product by Addition will
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46331:171"/> be 9, exceeding and exceeded by the same parts of the Extreams. In this manner the <hi>Mediums</hi> are found out. Now these <hi>Mediums</hi> are so to be dispos'd and plac'd to fill up the duple and triple Intervals. For of these propos'd Numbers, some have no middle Space, others have no sufficient. Being therefore so augmented that the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions may remain, they will afford sufficient space for the foresaid <hi>Mediums.</hi> To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, instead of a Unite, they choose the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber six, as being the first Number including in it self a half and third part, and so multiplying all the Figures below it and above it by 6, they made sufficient room to receive the <hi>Medium</hi> both in double and triple Distances, as in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

                  <p>Now <hi>Plato</hi> having laid down this for a Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Distances of <hi>Sesquialters,</hi> and <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terces,</hi> and <hi>Sesquioctaves</hi> being once found out, all the <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> Distances were fill'd up from those Connexions, in the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> Intervals, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a part of each, so as the Distance left of the part might bear the proportional Extreams of Number to Number, as 256 to 243. From hence they were constrain'd to enlarge their Number and make them bigger, that there might be two Numbers following in order in <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> proportion; the six not being sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain two <hi>Sesquioctaves,</hi> though you should bruise it into ten thousand Unites, which would strangely perplex the Study of these things, Therefore
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46331:171"/> the Occasion it self advis'd Multiplication. As in the Musical Scale, the Change and Variation of Notes extends it self upward and downward from the first innumerical Proportions of the Base, <hi>Eudorus</hi> therefore imitating <hi>Cranter,</hi> made choice of 384 for his first Number, being the product of 64 multiply'd by 6, which way of proceeding the Number 64, lead them to, containing it's under <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> 9, in proportion to 72. But it is more agreeable to the Words of <hi>Plato</hi> to introduce the half. For the remainder of that will bear a <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> proportion in those Numbers which <hi>Plato</hi> mentions of 256 to 248, making use of 192, for the first Number. But if the same Number be made choice of doubl'd, the Overplus or Default will have the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the doubl'd Number 512 to 484. For 256 is in <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> proportion to 192, as 394 to 512. Neither was <hi>Cranters</hi> Reduction of proportions to this Number without reason, which made his Followers willing to pursue it. In regard that 64 is both a <hi>Tetragon</hi> from the first <hi>Cube,</hi> and a <hi>Cube</hi> from the first <hi>Tetragon,</hi> and being multiplied by 3, the odd and <hi>Trigonal,</hi> and the first perfect and <hi>Sesquialter</hi> Number it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces 192, which also contains its <hi>Sesquioctave,</hi> as we shall demonstrate. But first of all we shall better understand what this <hi>Leimme</hi> or Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, and what was the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> if we do but call to mind what was frequently ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd in the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Schools. For Interval in Musick is all that Space which is comprehended by two sounds, vary'd either by raising the Voice, or scruing the String. Of which Intervals that which is call'd a Tone is the full excess of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente</hi> above a <hi>Diatessaron:</hi> And this being divided
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46331:172"/> into two parts according to the Opinion of the Musitians, makes two Intervals, both which they call a <hi>Semitone.</hi> But the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> despairing to divide a Tone into equal parts, and therefore perceiving the two Divisions to be unequal, they call'd the lesser <hi>Leimme</hi> or <hi>Defect,</hi> as being lesser then the half. Therefore some there are who make the <hi>Dratessaron,</hi> which is one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, to consist of two Tones and a half; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of two Tones and a <hi>Leimme.</hi> In which Case, Sense seems to govern the <hi>Musitians,</hi> and Demonstration the <hi>Mathematicians.</hi> The proof by Demonstration is thus made out. For that it is certain from the practice of Instruments, that the <hi>Diapason</hi> has double proportion; the <hi>Diapente</hi> a <hi>Sesquialter;</hi> the <hi>Diatessaron</hi> a <hi>Sesquiterce,</hi> and the Tone a <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> proportion. Now the truth of this will easily appear upon examination, by hanging two Weights double in proportion to two Strings, or by making two Pipes of equal hollowness, double in length, the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the bigger of the Pipes will yield the deep sound, as <hi>D sol re,</hi> to <hi>D la sol re:</hi> and of the two Strings that which is extended by the double weight, will be acuter then the other, as <hi>D la sol re</hi> to <hi>De sol re:</hi> And thus much for a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pason.</hi> In the same manner two Longitudes or Ponderosities being exceeded or extended by three will produce a <hi>Diapente;</hi> and four by three will yield a <hi>Diatessaron:</hi> of which, the one carries a <hi>Sesquiterce,</hi> the other a <hi>Sesquialter</hi> Proportion. But if the same inequality of weight or length be so ordered, as <hi>Nine</hi> to <hi>Eight,</hi> it will produce a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac Interval, not perfect Concord, but Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical enough: in regard the Strings being struck one after another, will yield so many musical and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46331:172"/> pleasing Sounds; but altogether a dull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Noise. But in Consort being touched either singly or together, thence a delightful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody will charm the Ear. Nor is all this less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable by Reason. For in Musick, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apason</hi> is compos'd of the <hi>Diapente</hi> and <hi>Diatessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> But in Numbers, the Duple is compounded of the <hi>Sesquialter</hi> and <hi>Sesquiterce.</hi> For 12 is a <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> to 9, but a <hi>Sesquialter</hi> to 8, and a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to 6. Therefore is the duple proportion compos'd of the <hi>Sesquialter</hi> and <hi>Sesquiterce,</hi> as the <hi>Diapason</hi> of the <hi>Dia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ente</hi> and <hi>Diatessaron.</hi> For here the <hi>Diapente</hi> exceeds the <hi>Diatessaron</hi> by Tone, there the <hi>Sesquialter</hi> exceeds <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> by a <hi>Sesquioctave.</hi> Whence it is apparent that the <hi>Diapason</hi> carries a double Proportion, the <hi>Diapente</hi> a <hi>Sesquialter,</hi> the <hi>Diatessaron</hi> a <hi>Sesquiterce,</hi> and the Tone a <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>octave.</hi> This being thus demonstrated, let us see whether the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> will admit a Division in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two equal parts; which if it will not do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will a Tone; however, in regard that 9 and 8, which make the first <hi>Sesquioctave,</hi> have no middle Interval; but being both multiply'd, the Space that falls between causes two Intervals, thence it is apparent, that if those Distances were equal, the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> also may be divided into equal parts. Now the double of 9 is 18, of 8, 16; the <hi>Intermedium</hi> 17; by which means one of the Intervals becomes larger, the other lesser; for the first is from 18 to 17, the second is from 17 to 16. Thus the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> proportion not being to be otherwise then unequally divided, consequently neither will the Tone admit of an equal Division. So that neither of these two Sections of a divided Tone are to be call'd a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitone,</hi> but according as the Mathematicians
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46331:173"/> name it, the <hi>Remainder.</hi> And this is that which <hi>Plato</hi> means, when he says, that God having fill'd up the <hi>Sesquiterces</hi> with <hi>Sesquioctaves,</hi> left a part of each: of which the Proportion is the same, as of 256 to 243, the remainder being 1 10/243. For admit a <hi>Diatessaron</hi> in two Numbers, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a <hi>Sesquiterce</hi> proportion, that is to say, in 256 and 192: Of which two Numbers, let the lesser 192 be apply'd to the lowermost Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and the bigger Number 256, to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost Extream of the <hi>Tetrachord.</hi> Whence we shall demonstrate, that this space being fill'd up by two <hi>Sesquioctaves,</hi> such an Interval remains as lyes between the Numbers 256 and 243. For the String being forc'd a full Tone downward, which is a <hi>Sesquioctave,</hi> it makes 216, but being screw'd a full Tone upward, it makes 243. Which 243 exceeds 216 by 27, and 216 exceeds 192 by 24. And then again, of these two Numbers, 27 is a <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> to 216, and 24 the <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>octave</hi> to 192. So the biggest of these two Numbers is a <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> to the middle, and the Middle to the least; and the distance from the least to the bigest, that is, from 192 to 243, consists of two Tones fill'd up with two <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>octaves.</hi> Which being substracted, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intervals of the whole between 243 and 216 is 13, for which reason they call'd this Number the <hi>Remainder.</hi> And thus I am apt to believe the Meaning and Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> to be most exactly explained in these Numbers. Others, placing the two Extreams of the <hi>Diatessaron,</hi> the acute part in 288, and the lower sound in 216, in all the rest observe the same Proportions, only that they make use of two Remainders of the two middle Intervals. For the Base being forc'd downward
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46331:173"/> a whole Tone, makes 243, and the upper Note screw'd up a full Tone, begets 256. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 243 carries a <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> proportion to 216 and 288 to 256, so that each of the Intervals contains a full Tone, and the residue is that which remains between 243 and 216. Which is not a <hi>Semitone</hi> but something less. For 288 exceeds 256 by 32, and 243 exceeds 216 by 27, and 256 exceeds 243 by 17. Both which Excesses are less then the half. So 'tis plain that the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessaron</hi> consists of two Tones and the Residue, not of two Tones and a half. And so let this suffice for the demonstration of these things. Nor is it a difficult thing to believe, by what has been already said, wherefore <hi>Plato,</hi> after he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the differences of <hi>Sesquialters, Sesquiterces</hi> and <hi>Sesquioctaves,</hi> when he comes to fill up the Intervals of <hi>Sesquiterces</hi> with <hi>Sesquioctaves,</hi> makes not the least mention of <hi>Sesquialters;</hi> for that the <hi>Sesquialter</hi> is soon fill'd up, by adding the <hi>Sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce</hi> to the <hi>Sesquioctave,</hi> or the <hi>Sesquioctave</hi> to the <hi>Sesquiterce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore shewn the manner how to fill up the Interval, and to place and dispose the <hi>Medieties;</hi> had never any Person taken the same Pains before, I should have recommended the further Consideration of it to the Recreation of your Fancies; but in regard that several most excellent Musicians have made it their Business to unfold these Mysteries with a Diligence more then usually exact, more especially <hi>Cranter, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> it shall only suffice to shew how these Men differ'd among themselves. For <hi>Theodorus,</hi> varying from the other two, and not observing two distinct Files or Rows of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but placing the Duples and Triples in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46331:174"/> Line one before another, grounds himself upon that Disposition of the Substance, which is vulgarly call'd the <hi>Disposition</hi> in <hi>Length,</hi> making two parts, as it were out of one, not four out of two. Then he says, that the Interpositions of the <hi>Mediums</hi> ought to take their Places in that manner, to avoid Trouble and Confusion; transferring out of the first Duple into the first <hi>Triple</hi> the Intervals which are ordained for the supplement of both. But as for those who take <hi>Crantor</hi>'s Part, they so dispose their Numbers, as to place <hi>Planes</hi> with <hi>Planes, Tetragons</hi> with <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Cubes</hi> with <hi>Cubes,</hi> opposite to one another, not taking them in File, but alternatively odd to even. <hi>[Here is some great defect in the Original.]</hi> Which being in themselves permanently the same, afford the Form and Species; but being subject to Corporeal Division, become the Matter and Subject to receive the others Impression, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mixture being compleated out of both.</p>
                  <p>Now the Indivisible Substance, which is always one and the same, is not to be thought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Division, by reason of its Smallness, like the most minute of Bodies, called Atoms. But as it is unmixt, and not to be any way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but pure and altogether of one sort, it is said not to consist of Parts, but to be indivisible. By means of which Purity, when it comes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner whatsoever, but to approach and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch compounded, divisible and differing Substances, all Variety ceases and crouds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one Habit by Simpathy and Similitude. But if any one will that Substance which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Corporeal Separation, <hi>Matter,</hi> as a Nature subject to the former, and partaking of it, the Use of that Equivocal Term will nothing disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46331:174"/> our Discourse. For they are under a Mistake that believe the Corporeal to be blended with the Indivisible Matter. <hi>First,</hi> For that <hi>Plato</hi> does not here make use of any one of its Names, whereas in other Places he calls it the Receptacle and <hi>Nurse,</hi> capable both to receive and foster the vast Infinity of created Beings; not divisible by Bodies, but ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her the Body it self, parted and divided into singular Individuals. Then again, what difference would there be, between the Creation of the World and the Soul, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of both proceeded from Matter and preceptible Substances? Certainly <hi>Plato</hi> himself, as endeavoring to separate the Generation of the Body from that of the Soul, tells us, that the Corporeal part was by God seated and deposited within it, and that it was outwardly covered and inveloped by it: and after he had thus wrought the Soul to its perfection out of Proportion, he then proceeds to this Argument concerning Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which he had no occasion to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before, when he was producing the Soul, as being that which had not its Existence from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The same may be said against the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Posidonius.</hi> For they seem not altogether to exempt the Soul from Matter; but imagining the Substance of the Extreams to be divisible in reference to Bodies, and intermixing it with the perceptible Substance, defin'd the Soul to be an <hi>Idea</hi> of some thing distanc'd according to Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber comprehending harmony: seeing that all Mathematick Objects are dispos'd between the first Intelligible, and the first sensible Beings. So that the Soul containing the <hi>Sempiternal</hi> of things intelligible, and the pathetick Nature of things subjected to Sence, it seems but Rational,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46331:175"/> that it should consist of a Substance between both. But they were ignorant, That God, when the Soul was already brought to perfection, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making use of the Extreams and Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bodies to form and shape the Matter, confin'd and environ'd the dissipated and fleeting Substance within the Compass of certain Surfaces compos'd of Triangles adapted together. Nor is it less, if not much more absurd, to make the Soul an <hi>Idea.</hi> For the Soul is always in motion, the other incapable of Motion; the one never to be mixt with that which is subjected to Sence, the other wrought into the Substance of the Body. Moreover, God could not only be said to imitate an <hi>Idea,</hi> as his Pattern; but he was the Artificer of the Soul, as of a Work of Perfection. Now that <hi>Plato</hi> does not assert Number to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Soul, only that it is order'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned by Number, enough has been already said.</p>
                  <p>However this is a common Argument against both the former Opinions, that neither in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Limits, nor in numbers there is the least Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step or appearance of the Power by which the Soul assumes to it self to judge of what is subject to Sence. For it was the Participation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Principle that endu'd it with Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the perceiving Faculty. But as for Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Belief, Imagination, and its being affected with Qualities relating to the Body, there no Man could ever dream, that they proceeded singly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Unites, or Lines, or Surfaces. For not only the Souls of Mortals have a Power to judge of what is subject to Sence, but the Soul of the World also, so says <hi>Plato,</hi> when it reverts to it self, and happens once to touch upon any fluid and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46331:175"/> roaving Substance; at what time the indivisible part being mov'd by its whole self, gives notice, to what this or that thing, is still the same; to what Heterogenial, to what end, and where, and how it comes to pass that all things act and suffer both upon, and by each other. Soon after mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Description of the Ten Predicaments, he gives Us a clearer Manifestation of these things. <hi>For true Reason,</hi> says he, <hi>when it is fix'd upon what is subject to Sence, and the Circle of that other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, mentioned in the beginning, observing a just and equal Motion, conveighs its Intelligence to the whole Soul, then both Opinion and Belief become sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and certain; on the other side, when it is setled upon Ratiocination; if the Circle of the same Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, turning readily and easily, furnishes the same happy Intimations, there Knowledge of necessity arrives to Perfection.</hi> And indeed in whomsoever these Accomplishments shall be found, whoever shall affirm them to be the Operations of any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Soul, may deservedly be thought to speak any thing rather than the Truth.</p>
                  <p>From whence then does the Soul enjoy this Motion, whereby it recollects by Thought and Apprehension what is subject to Sence, different from that other intelligible Motion, which ends in Knowledge, is a difficult Task to resolve; unless we stedfastly assert, that <hi>Plato</hi> here did not compose the Soul, so singly consider'd, but the Soul of the World also of the Parts above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, of the more worthy and indivisible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and of the less worthy divisible in reference to Bodies, which is no other than that Motion which gives Heat and Vigor to Thought and Fancy, and sympathises with what is subject to Fancy, not created, but existing from Eternity
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46331:176"/> like the other. For Nature, which had the Power of Understanding, had also the Power of Thinking. But the intelligible Power is neither subject to Motion, nor Affection, being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd upon a Substance that is still the same. The other moveable and fleeting, as being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to an unstable, fluctuating and disunited Matter: in regard the sensible Substance was so far from any Order, that it was without Shape, and boundless. So that the Power which is fix'd in this was incapable of producing clear and well grounded Notions, nor any certain or well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Movements, but sleepy Dreams and Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, which amuse and trouble corporeal Stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; unless by accident they lighted upon the more worthy Substance. For it was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between the <hi>Sensible</hi> and discerning Faculty, and a Nature conformable and agreeable to both; from the sensible, claiming Substance, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Judgment its descerning Power. Which the express Words of <hi>Plato</hi> declare. <hi>For this is my Opinion,</hi> saith he, <hi>in short, that Being, Place and Procreation, were three distinct things before the Heavens were created.</hi> By Place he means Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as being the Seat and Receptacle; by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Existence, the intelligible Nature; and by Generation, the World not being yet created, he only designs that Substance which was subject to Changes and Motions, dispos'd between the forming Cause, and the Thing form'd; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting hither those Shapes and Figures which were there contriv'd and moulded. For which reason it was call'd Divisible; there being a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of distributing Sence to the Sensitive, and Imagination to the Considerative Faculty. For the sensitive Motion being proper to the Soul, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46331:176"/> it self to that which is outwardly sensible. As for the Understanding, it was fix'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable of it self, but being settl'd in the Soul, and becoming its Lord and Governor, whirls about and finishes that Circular Violence which chiefly labours to apply it self to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally durable Substance. With great difficulty therefore did they admit a Conjunction, till the Divisible at length intermixing with the Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the restlesly hurry'd with the sleepy and motionless, constrain'd the diversly opposite to be glad of their Society. Yet the diversly Opposite was not Motion, as neither was the <hi>Same</hi> Stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Principal of Distinction and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or <hi>Identity.</hi> For both the one and the other proceed from a different Principle; the <hi>Same</hi> from the Unite, the <hi>Other</hi> from the <hi>Duad;</hi> and these were first intermix'd with the Soul, being fasten'd and bound together by Number, Proportion, and Harmonical Mediums: So that the <hi>Other</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riveted into the <hi>Same,</hi> begets Diversity and Disagreement; and the <hi>Same</hi> being fermented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Other</hi> produces Order; and this is apparent from the first Powers of the Soul; which are Judgment and Motion. Motion immediately shews it self in the Heavens, giving us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Diversity in <hi>Identity</hi> by the Circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the fix'd Stars; and of <hi>Identity</hi> in Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity by the Order of the Planets. For in them the <hi>Same</hi> bears the chiefest sway; in Terrestrial Bodies quite the contrary. Judgment has two Principles; Understanding from the <hi>Same,</hi> to judge of things in general; and Sence from the <hi>Other,</hi> to judge of things in particular. Reason is a mixture of Both; Consideration in reference to things intelligible; and Opinion in things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46331:177"/> to Sence; making use of the interpos'd Organs of Imagination and Memory. Of which, these in the <hi>Same</hi> produce the <hi>Other,</hi> and those in the <hi>Other</hi> make the <hi>Same.</hi> For <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> is the Motion of the Considerative Faculty, toward that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and stable. Opinion is a Continuance of that which is perceiv'd by Sence, upon that which is continually in Motion. But as for Fancy or Imagination, being a Connexion of Opinion with Sence, the <hi>Same</hi> has plac'd it in the Memory: And the <hi>Other</hi> moves it again in the Difference between Past and Present, touching at the same time upon Diversity and Identity.</p>
                  <p>But now let us take a Draught of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding Composition of the Soul from the Structure of the Body of the Universe: There we find the pure and limpid Fire, together with the Earth, whose Nature is such as not to admit of Mixture one with another, but with great difficulty; or rather altogether obstinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to Mixture and Consistency. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore placing in the middle between both, the Air next the Fire, the Water next the Earth, first of all temper'd the middlemost one with another, and next by the assistance of these two, he brought the two Extream Elements not only to mix with the middlemost, but also to a mutual Closure and Conjunction between themselves. Then he drew together the <hi>Same</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> not immediately the one adjoyning to the other, but placing other Substances between, the Indivisible next the <hi>Same,</hi> and the Divisible next the <hi>Other,</hi> disposing each to each in convenient Order, and mixing the Extreams with the Middlemost. After which manner he interweav'd and tissu'd the whole into the Form and Composition of the Soul, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46331:177"/> as far as it was possible, Similitude out of things different and various, and one out of many. Therefore it is alledg'd by some, that <hi>Plato</hi> erroneously affirm'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Other</hi> to be an Enemy to Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not being only capable to receive it, but a Friend of Change. Whereas that should have been rather said of the Nature of the same, which being Stable and an utter Adversary to Mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is so far from an easie and willing Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Mixture, that it flies and abhors it, to the end it may preserve it self pure and free from Alteration. But they who make these Objections against <hi>Plato,</hi> betray their own Ignorance, not understanding that the <hi>Same</hi> is the <hi>Idea</hi> of those Things that always continue in the same State and Condition: and that the other is the <hi>Idea</hi> of those Things which are subject to be variously affected; and that it is the peculiar Nature of the one to disjoyn, and separate into many parts whatever it haapens to lay hold upon; of the other, to cement and assimilate scatter'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous Substances, till they resume one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Form and Efficacy. And these are the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Vertues of the Soul of the Universe. Which when they once enter into the Organs of corruptible Bodies, there the Form of the Binary and boundless Principle shews it self most briskly, while that of the unmixt and purer Principle lies as it were dormant in Obscurity. And thus it happens, that a Man shall rarely observe any such sort of Human Passion or Motion of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, where there shall not something ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, either of Desire or Emulation, Joy or Grief (which certainly proceed from the more powerful Sway of the Dual Principle in Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46331:178"/> Bodies, as being subject to Disorder and Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancy.) Several Philosophers therefore will have the Passions to be so many sorts of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; seeing that both Desire, Grief and Anger are the Effects of Judgment. Others alledge the Vertues themselves to be Passions; Fortitude being subject to Fear, Temperance to Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and Justice to Avarice. Now the Soul being both speculative and practical, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as well Generals as Particulars, and seeming to comprehend the one by the assistance of the Understanding, and the other by the aid of Sence, common Reason, which encounters the <hi>Same</hi> in the <hi>Other,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> in the <hi>Same,</hi> endeavors by certain Limits and Distinctions to separate <hi>One</hi> from <hi>Many,</hi> and the Divisible from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible: but cannot accomplish her Design, nor be purely in one or the other, in regard the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are so odly interwoven and intermix'd, and confusedly hudled together.</p>
                  <p>For this Reason did God constitute a Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the <hi>Same</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> out of the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and Divisible Substance to the end there might be Order in Variety. For this was to have a Being, since that without these, the <hi>Same</hi> cannot be allow'd to have either Variety or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Procreation. Nor the <hi>Other</hi> be said to have either Order or Consistence, or Generation. For should we grant the <hi>Same</hi> to be different from the <hi>Other,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> to be the same with it self, such a Commixture would produce nothing Generative, but would want a Third, if I may so call it, <hi>Matter,</hi> to receive and be dispos'd of by both, and this is that Matter which God first compos'd, when he bounded the moveable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bodies, by the stedfastness of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46331:178"/> Now then as Voice, meerly Voice, is only an insignificant and brutish Noise; as Speech is only the Expression of the Mind by significant Utterance; as Harmony consists of Sounds and Intervals; which being mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produce Air and Melody. Thus the passive Nature of the Soul was without Limits and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, but afterwards became terminated by that common bound which circumscribes the divisible Variety of Motion, which having compris'd the <hi>Same</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> by the Similitudes and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of Numbers causing Concord of Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, becomes the Life of the World, sober and prudent, Harmony it self, and Reason by perswasion overruling Necessity, which by several is call'd Fate or Destiny; by <hi>Empedocles</hi> Friendship and Discord; by <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> the opposite straining of the Congruity of the World, like the Strings of a Bow or Harp, whose ends draw several ways; by <hi>Parmenides</hi> Light and Darkness; by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> Wisdom and Folly; by <hi>Zoroastres,</hi> God and the Devil, naming one <hi>Oromasdes,</hi> the other <hi>Arimarius.</hi> Though as for <hi>Euripides,</hi> he makes use of the Copulative erroneously for the Disjunctive, where he says,
<q>
                        <l>—<hi>Jove,</hi> whether he may be</l>
                        <l>Necessity that Natures Force controuls,</l>
                        <l>Or the Intelligence of Human Souls.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For indeed the Powers which bears Dominion over the Universe are Necessity and Wisdom. This is that therefore which the Fabulous <hi>Egyptian</hi> intimate, feigning that when <hi>Orus</hi> was punish'd and dismembred; he bequeath'd his Spirit and Blood to his Father, but his Flesh and his Fat to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46331:179"/> his Mother; there being no part of the Soul which remain'd pure and unmix'd, or separate from the rest. For that, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> Harmony Latent, is of greater Value than that which is visible, as being that wherein the blending Deity conceal'd and sunk all Varieties and Dissimilitudes. Nevertheless there appears in the irrational part, a turbulent and boistrous Temerity; in the rational part, an orderly and well marshall'd Prudence; in the sensitive part, the Constraint of Necessity, but in the Understanding, entire and perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it self. The limiting and bounding Power sympathizes with the whole and the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, by reason of the nearness of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the other side, the dividing Power fixes it self upon Particulars, by virtue of the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Substance: and the whole rejoyces at the Mutation of the <hi>Same</hi> into the <hi>Other,</hi> as occasion requires. In like manner, the various Inclinations of Men to Vertue and Vice, to Pleasure and Toyl, as also the Enthusiasms and Raptures of Lovers, the Combats of Honor with lustful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, plainly demonstrate the Mixture of the Divine and Impassible, with the Mortal and Corporeal Part. Of which <hi>Plato</hi> himself calls the one <hi>Concupiscence</hi> of Pleasures natural to our selves; the other an Opinion introduc'd from without aspiring to the chiefest Good. For passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities of the Souls which are cross'd and hurry'd to and fro by the Affections arise from her self; but she participates of Understanding, as being infus'd from without, by the more worthy Principle, which is God. Nor is the Celestial Nature priviledg'd from this. For sometimes it is seen to encline the other way,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46331:179"/> to the more powerful Revolution of the <hi>Same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, there shall come a time, as it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd already, when the Worlds moving Wisdom shall grow dull and drowzy, drown'd in Oblivion of its own Duty, while that which is familiar, and agreeable to the Body from the beginning draws and winds back the right hand Motion of the Universe, causing the Wheels to go slow and heavy: Yet shall it not be able however to dash in pieces the whole Movement, for that the <hi>Better Part</hi> rowzing and recollecting her self, and observing the Pattern and Exemplar of the All-directing Deity, betakes her self to speedy Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and thereby retrieves her Negligence, and reduces all things again into their former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is demonstrable by many Proofs, that the Soul was not the sole Workmanship of the Deity, but that having in her self a certain Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of innate Evil, it was by him digested and beautify'd, while he confin'd its Infinity to the <hi>Ʋnite,</hi> to the end it might be a Substance within the Compass of certain Limits; intermixing Order, Mutation and Variety by the Force of the <hi>Same,</hi> and the <hi>Other;</hi> and lastly, working into all these, as far as it was possible, a mutual Community and Friendship by the Assistance of Numbers and Harmony. Concerning which things, although you have heard frequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and have likewise read several Arguments and Disputes committed to writing upon the same Subjects, it will not be amiss for me also to give a short Account; after a brief Repetition of <hi>Plato</hi>'s own Words. <hi>God,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the first place withdrew one part from the whole; which done,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46331:180"/> he took away ths half of that; from thence a Third Part,</hi> Sesquialter <hi>in proportion to the Second, and Triple to the First: Then a Fourth Part, double to the Second; next a Fifth Part, being the Triple of the Third; then a Sixth, the Eighth Part of the Third; and lastly, a Seventh, being the Twenty Seventh Part of the First. This done, he fill'd up the Duple and Triple Intervals, retrenching also from thence certain other Particles, and placing them in the midst of those Intervals; so that in every Interval there might be two</hi> Medieties, <hi>the one exceeding and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by one and the same part of the Extreams; the other equally exceeding, and being equally exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same Number.</hi> Now in regard that from these Connexions in the first Spaces there arose the Intervals of <hi>Sesquialters, Sesquiterces</hi> and <hi>Octaves,</hi> he fill'd up all the <hi>Sesquiterces</hi> belonging to the <hi>Octave</hi> Interval, leaving a part of every one, and the distance of the Part so taken from Number to Number, having for their Bounds or Limits 256, and 343. Here the Question will be first concerning the Quantity, next concerning the Order, and in the third place, concerning the Force and Vertue of the Numbers. As to the Quantity, we are to consider which he takes in double Intervals. As to the Order, whither they are to be plac'd in one Row, according to the Direction of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> or as <hi>Cranter</hi> will have them, in the Form of a <hi>Λamda,</hi> placing the <hi>Ʋnite</hi> at the top, and the Duples and Triples apart by themselves in two several Files. Lastly, we are to examine of what Use and Vertue they are in the Structure and Composition of the Soul. As to the first, we shall relinquish the Opinion of those who affirm, that it is enough, in Proportions, to consider the Nature of the Intervals, and the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46331:180"/>
                     <hi>Medieties,</hi> which fill up their Vacancies: The Demonstration being to be made out of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Numbers that have Spaces sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the aforesaid Proportion. For this being granted, it makes the Demonstration obscure, without the help of Schemes, and drives us from another Theory, which carries with it a delight not unbecoming Philosophy.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Connexion is made of Numbers put together in order: The first Connexion being of One and Two, the second of Odd.

                  <p>But it belongs to others to explain these things more accurately and distinctly, while we content our selves with only what remains, as peculiarly proper to the Subject in hand. For it was not out of Vain-glory, to boast his Skill in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Sciences, that <hi>Plato</hi> inserted in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Natural Philosophy this Discourse of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal and Arithmetical <hi>Medieties,</hi> but believing them both apt and convenient to demonstrate the Structure and Composition of the Soul. For some there are who seek these Proportions, in the swift Motions of the Spheres of the Planets, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> rather in the Distances, others in the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the Stars; others more accurate and nice in their Inquiry, seek for the same Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Diameters of the <hi>Epicycles:</hi> as if the Supream Architect, for the Sake of These; had adapted the Soul, divided into seven parts, to the Celestial Bodies. Many also there are, who hither transfer the Inventions of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> tripling the Distances of Bodies from the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. This is done by placing the <hi>Ʋnite</hi> next the Fire; <hi>Three,</hi> next the Earth which is opposite to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46331:181"/> our Earth; <hi>Nine,</hi> next the Earth; 27 next the Moon. Next to <hi>Mercury</hi> 84. Upon <hi>Venus</hi> 143, and upon the <hi>Sun</hi> 729. Which is both a <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal</hi> and <hi>Cubical</hi> Number: from whence it is, that they also call the <hi>Sun</hi> a <hi>Tetragon</hi> and a <hi>Cube:</hi> and by this way of tripling they also reduce the other <hi>Stars</hi> to Proportion. But these People may be thought to dote, and to wander very much from Reason, if there be any use of Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Demonstration, since by their Mistakes we find that the most probable Proofs proceed from thence; and that though they who most strictly adhere to Probability, do not always make out their Positions so exactly, yet they approach the nearest to Truth, when they say that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the <hi>Sun,</hi> compar'd with the Diameter of the Earth, bears the Proportion of 42 to 1. The Diameter of the Earth to that of the <hi>Moon</hi> carrys a Tripple Proportion. And for that which appears to be the least of the fix'd <hi>Stars,</hi> the Diameter of it is no less then the third part of the Diameter of the Earth, and the whole Globe of the Earth to the whole Globe of the <hi>Moon</hi> is as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Twenty One. The Diameters of <hi>Venus</hi> and the Earth bear a duple, the Globes or Spheres of both an <hi>Octave</hi> Proportion. The Distance of the Shadow of the <hi>Eccliptick</hi> to the Diameter of the <hi>Moon</hi> holds a Triple Proportion and the Deviation of the <hi>Moon</hi> from the middle of the Signs either to the one or the other side, is a twelfth Part. Her Positions as to the <hi>Sun,</hi> either in <hi>Triangular</hi> or <hi>Quadrangular</hi> distances gives her the Form when she appears as in the first Quarter, and almost at the Full: but when she comes to be quite round, that is, when she has run through half the Signs, she then makes as it
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46331:182"/> were a kind of Concord of a <hi>Diapason.</hi> But in regard the Motions of the <hi>Sun</hi> are slowest when he arrives at the <hi>Solstices,</hi> and swiftest when he comes to the <hi>Equinoxes,</hi> by which he takes from the Day, or adds to the Night, the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holds thus. For the first thirty Days after the Winter <hi>Solstice,</hi> he adds to the Day a sixth part of the Length, wherein the longest Night exceeded the shortest: the next thirty Days, he adds a third Part; to all the rest, till the <hi>Equinox,</hi> by <hi>Sextuple</hi> and triple Distances to even the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of time.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the <hi>Caldeans</hi> make a Spring to hold the Proportion of a <hi>Diatessaron</hi> to <hi>Autumn;</hi> of a <hi>Diapente</hi> to the Winter, and of a <hi>Diapason</hi> to the Summer. But if <hi>Euripides</hi> rightly divided the Year, where he says,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Six Months</hi> the parching Heats of Summer raign;</l>

                           <hi>And two Months</hi> more to <hi>Autumn</hi> Tribute pay.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Seasons shall be said to change in <hi>Octave</hi> Proportion.</p>
                  <p>Others there are, who fancy the Earth to be in the lowest String of the Harp, according to the most antient Scale call'd <hi>Proslambanomenos,</hi> or <hi>Are,</hi> and so proceeding, place the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>B mi: Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>C fa ut</hi> and <hi>D sol re;</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> they likewise place in <hi>Elami,</hi> as in the midst of the <hi>Diapason</hi> a Fifth above the Earth, and a Fourth from the Sphere of the fixed Stars. But neither does this pleasant Conceit of theirs come near the Truth, neither do they in any wise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Accurateness of Proportion.</p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:46331:182"/>
                  <p>However, they who will not allow these things to depend upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s Sentiments, yet will they grant the same to partake of Musical Proportions. So that there being five <hi>Tetrachords</hi> of Base and Tenor, of mean Notes conjoyn'd from <hi>Alamire</hi> with <hi>B</hi> flat, and Notes disjoyn'd from <hi>B</hi> sharp to <hi>Elimi</hi> sharp, and the Treble <hi>Tetrachord</hi> from <hi>Elimi</hi> to <hi>Alamire</hi> in <hi>G sol re ut</hi> Clift in these five Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances they place all the Planets; making the first <hi>Tetrachord</hi> from the <hi>Moon</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> all observing the Solar Motion: the next from the <hi>Sun</hi> to the fiery Planet of <hi>Mars:</hi> the third between this and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the fourth from thence to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the fifth from <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Sphere of the fix'd Stars: So that the Sounds and Notes which bound the five <hi>Tetrachords</hi> bear the same Proportion with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of the Planets. This might be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable among the Antient Musicians, who as well we know confin'd their Scale to seven standing Notes equal in Number to the Number of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. But the Moders adding the <hi>Proslambanomenos</hi> or <hi>Are,</hi> which is a full Tone in descent from <hi>B mi,</hi> have multiply'd the whole Scheme into the double <hi>Diapason,</hi> and thereby confounded the Natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Concords, while the <hi>Diapente</hi> happens to be before the <hi>Tetrachordon,</hi> with the Addition of the whole Tone in the Base. Whereas <hi>Plato</hi> makes his Addition in the upper Part. For in his <hi>Politick Discourses,</hi> he says, that every one of the <hi>Eight</hi> Spheres rouls about a <hi>Syren,</hi> which is fix'd upon each of the tuneful Globes, and that they all sing one unvary'd Counterpoint, and unfigur'd without diversity of Modulation, taking every one their peculiar Concords, which together com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a melodious Consort.</p>

                  <p>They further add, that their Harmonious plain Song serves them to celebrate several Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries no less delightfully useful, while Celestial Voices, according with Heavenly Instruments, may seem to serve as a Recreation to those that are oblig'd continually to dance the Sacred Rounds of Nature. Nor was there Necessity of a fuller Chorus, in regard that within the Confines of eight Notes, lay the first Bounds and Limits of all Duple and Triple Proportions; The Unite being added to the Separations of the Even and Odd Numbers.</p>
                  <p>And certainly from hence it was, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients rais'd their Invention of nine Muses; of which eight were employ'd in Celestial Affairs; the Ninth was to take care of things Terrestrial, and to reduce and reform the Inequality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Error and jarring Variance.</p>
                  <p>Now then consider whether the Soul does not roul and turn and manage the Heavens, and the Celestial Bodies by means of those Harmonious Concords and equal Motions that are wrought and fermented within her; being her self most wise and most just: and such she became by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Harmonical Proportions. Whose Images are imprinted by the Incorporeal into the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable and visible Parts and Bodies of the World. But the Chief and most predominating Power is mix'd in the Soul, which renders her obsequient and obedient to the most supream and divinest Part of all the rest at the same time, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously consenting. For the Soveraign Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and Creator finding a strange Disorder and erroneous Confusion in the Motions of the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and unruly Soul, which was still at variance with her self, some things he divided and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46331:184"/> others he brought together, and reconcil'd to a mutual Sympathy, making use of Harmony and Numbers. By Vertue of which the slightest and meanest of insensible Substances, even Sticks and Stones, the Roots of Plants, the Rinds of Trees, the Skins and Excrescences of Beasts, with the Superfluities of their Concoction, according to their various Mixtures, Compositions and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures, some become the charming Objects of the Sight, others afford most pleasing perfumes and wholsome Medicaments for the Succour and Relief of Mankind, while others are wrought and hollow'd to send forth those pleasing Sounds that ravish even the Soul it self with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of her conceal'd Beauties and Concinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And for this Reason it was that <hi>Zeno</hi> the Citizen encouraged and perswaded Youth to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Theaters, there to observe the Variety of melodious Sounds that proceeded from Horns or Cornets, wooden Haut-boys, Flutes and Reeds, or any other Musical Instruments, to which the Contrivance of Art had rightly apply'd the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Number and Proportion. Not that we will here maintain with the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> that all things resemble Number, for that requires a long Discourse to prove it. But where mutual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sympathy arises from Discord and Dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, that the Cause of this is Moderation and Order, was a thing not conceal'd from the less studious Poets; who therefore to Persons full of Humanity, sweet of Disposition, and friendly, gave the Epithite of <hi>evenly concinnated:</hi> On the other side, Men of rugged and malicious Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions they call'd <hi>Ʋnevenly Temper'd,</hi> as if Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Discord were nothing but a sort of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion. For this reason, he who writes
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46331:184"/>
                     <hi>Pindarus</hi>'s <hi>Elegy</hi> gives him this Encomium.</p>

                  <p>The Poets plainly hence inferring Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Humor, and the Aptitude of a Person to fit himself to all Tempers to be an Excellency aspiring to Vertue it self.

                  </q>
                  <p>Nor must we believe that the <hi>Theologists,</hi> who were the most antient Philosophers, order'd the Pictures and Statues of the Gods to be made with musical Instruments in their Hands, as if they thought the Gods no better than Pipers or Harpers, but to signifie that nothing so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the Structure of the World to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece of a God, as the Order and Sympathy of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>Now then as it would be absurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for any Man to search for <hi>Sesquiterces, Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quialters</hi> and Duples in the Neck or Belly or Sides of a <hi>Lute</hi> or <hi>Harp</hi> (though every one of these must also be allow'd their <hi>Symmetry</hi> of Length and Thickness) the Harmony and Proportion of Concords being to be sought for in the Sounds; so 'tis most probable that the Bodies of the Stars, the Distances of the Spheres, and the Swiftness of their Motions and Revolutions, as instrumental Organs, have their sundry Proportions as well one
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46331:185"/> to another, as to the whole Fabrick, though the Measure of the Quantity be unknown to us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are to imagine that the Principle, Effect and Efficacy of these Numbers and Proportions, which the supream Architect made use of, is that same Agreement, Harmony and Consent of the Soul with it self, by means of which Numbers she replenish'd the Heavens themselves, when she came to actuate and perform her Office there, with so many infinite Beauties; and governs the Earth by vertue of the several Seasons, and other Alterations wisely and artificially measur'd and vary'd as to Mixture and Temperature, as well for the Generation as Preservation of all Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Productions.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>This Epistolary discourse was wrote against an ill bred sort of Philosophers, who neither would take the charge of the Education of great Persons themselves, nor would suffer others to do it, though the Author seems here only to vindicate his Friend, it is in Truth an Apology for himself, who bred up an Emperor, and spent most part of his time (to good purpose) in the greatest Court in the World: This and several other of his Moral Discourses seems to be hastily dictated, so that there is no great choice in his Words, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his Periods, or strict method in the whole: However the Treasure of ancient Learning and good Sence, which is to be found in him, as it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made use of by the most Eloquent Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so it is sufficient to recommend his Works to all lovers of Larning and good Manners.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Resolution which you have taken to enter into the Friendship and Familiarity of <hi>Soranus,</hi> that by the frequent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of conversing with him, you may cultivate
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46331:186"/> and improve a Soil, which gives such <hi>early</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of a <hi>plentiful Harvest,</hi> is an undertaking which will not only oblige his Relations and Friends, but redound very much to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>publick;</hi> and (notwithstanding the Peevish Censures of some Morose or Ignorant People) it is so far from being an argument of aspiring and vain-glorious Temper, that it shows you to be a Lover of Vertue and good Manners, and a zealous Promoter of the common Interest of Mankind.</p>
               <p>They themselves are rather to be accused of an <hi>indirect,</hi> but more <hi>Vehement</hi> sort of Ambition, who would not upon any Terms be found in the Company, or so much as be seen to give a civil Salute to a Person of quality. For how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable would it be to enforce a well disposed Young Gentleman, and one who needs the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a wise Governour, to such complaints as these, I could wish that instead of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Fortune, this Title and this Estate to which I was born, that I had been the Son of some Scriviner or pitiful Mechanic, that I might like them, have the Conversation of such a Man as <hi>Socrates,</hi> enjoy his Company, and hear his instructive Lessons of Morality.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Aristo <hi>of</hi> Chios.</note>So far I am sure was an excellent Philosopher from being of their humour, that when he was censured for exposing and prostituting the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Philosophy, by his freedom to all comers, he answered, <hi>That he could wish that Nature had given understanding to wild Beasts, that they too might be capable of being his Hearers.</hi> Shall we then deny that priviledge to Men of Interest and Power, which this good Man would have communicated (if it had been possible) to the brute Beasts? But
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46331:186"/> these Men have taken up a false notion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, they make it much like the Art of <hi>Statuary,</hi> whose business is to carve out a liveless Image, in the most exact figure and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then to raise it upon its pedestal, where it is to continue for ever, the true Philosophy is of a quite different nature, it is a spring and principle of <hi>Motion</hi> where ever it comes; it makes Men active and industrious, it sets every <hi>Whoel</hi> and Faculty of <hi>going,</hi> it stores our <hi>Minds</hi> with axioms and rules, by which to make a sound Judgment, it determines the <hi>Will</hi> to the choice of what is honourable and just: and it wings all our <hi>faculties</hi> to the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Prosecution of it. It is accompanied with an <hi>Elevation</hi> and <hi>Nobleness</hi> of mind, joyned with a <hi>coolness</hi> and <hi>sweetness</hi> of Behaviour? Back'd with a <hi>becoming assurance</hi> and <hi>inflexible resolution.</hi> And from this diffussiveness of the Nature of <hi>good,</hi> it follows that the best and most <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Men are inclined to converse with Persons of the highest condition.

               <p>His Passion does not stand in defiance to his reason, nor do his Reasonings cross, and thwart one the other, but he is always consistent to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the very <hi>Joys</hi> of wicked Men are <hi>tumultuary</hi> and <hi>confus'd,</hi> like those who dwell in the Borders of two great Empires at variance, always <hi>insecure,</hi> and in perpetual Alarums; whilest a Good Man enjoys an uninterrupted <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Serenity</hi> of Mind, which excels the other not only in <hi>duration,</hi> but in <hi>Sense</hi> of pleasure too. As for the other sort of Reason, that which consists in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it self to others, <hi>Pindar</hi> says very well, that it was not mercenary in old time, nor indeed is it so now, but by the baseness and ambition of a few is made use of to serve their poor secular Interest; for if the Poets represent <hi>Venus</hi> her self as much offended with those, who make a Trade and Traffick of the Passion of Love; how
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46331:188"/> much more reasonably may we suppose that <hi>Ʋrania,</hi> and <hi>Clio</hi> and <hi>Caliope</hi> have an Indignation against those who set Learning, and Philosophy to Sale? Certainly the gifts and endowments of the Muses ought much rather to be priviledged from such mean considerations, — if indeed some have made Fame and Reputation one of the ends of their Studies, they used it only as an Instrument to get Friends, since we find by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon observation that Men only praise them whom they love, if they sought it for its own praise, they were as much mistaken as <hi>Ixion,</hi> when he embraced a <hi>Cloud</hi> instead of <hi>Juno;</hi> for there is nothing so fleeting, so changeable and inconstant as popular applause, it is but a <hi>pompous shadow,</hi> and hath no manner of solidity and duration in it; but a wise Man if he design to engage in business and matters of State, will so far aim at Fame and Popularity, as that he may be better enabled to benefit others; for it is a difficult and very unpleasant Task to do good to those who are <hi>disaffected</hi> to our Persons. It is the good opinion men have of us, which disposes Men to give credit to our Doctrine: As Light is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good to those who see others by it, then to those who only are seen: So is Honour of a greater benefit to those who know how to use it, than to those who are careless or insensible of it. But even such a one who withdraws himself from the noise of the World, who loves privacy and indulges his own thoughts will show that respect to the good word of the People, as <hi>Hippolytus</hi> did to <hi>Venus,</hi> though he abstain from her <hi>Mysteries,</hi> he will pay his Devotions at a <hi>Distance,</hi> but he will not be so <hi>Cynical</hi> and sullen, as not to hear
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46331:189"/> with gladness the commendations of vertuous Men like himself; he will neither engage himself in a restless pursuit of Wealth, Interest or Honour, nor will he on the other hand be so rustick and insensible as to refuse them in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree; when they fairly come in his way; in like manner he will not court and follow hansom and beautiful Youths, but will rather chuse such who are of a <hi>teachable</hi> Disposition, of a gentile behaviour and lovers of Learning: The Charms and Graces of Youth will not make a Philosopher shy of their Conversation, when the endowments of their Minds, are answerable to to the Features of their Bodies; the case is the same when greatness of place and fortune concur with a well dispos'd Mind in the same Person, he will not therefore forbear loving and respecting them, nor be afraid of the name of a <hi>Courtier,</hi> nor think it a <hi>Curse</hi> that such <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> should be his <hi>Fate.</hi>

               <p>The application is easie to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>A Philosopher therefore, though of a retir'd humor, will be thus affected; but such a one who generously designs his Studies for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advantage, will chearfully embrace their advances of Friendship, will hear as well as be heard, lay aside his Scholastical Terms and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, nor confound his novices with the <hi>barbarous</hi> sound of <hi>baralypton.</hi>

                  </note> that it is <hi>both more noble and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do; than to receive a kindness;</hi> for there is nothing which produces so human and genuine a sort of pleasure, as that of doing good, he who first gave the Name of the three <hi>Graces</hi> well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood this, for they all signifie * <hi>Delectation</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> This is so evidently true, that we all receive good turns blushing, and with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but we are always gay and well pleased, when we are conferring one.</p>
               <p>If then it is so pleasant to do good to a few, how are their Hearts dilated with joy, who are <hi>Benefactors</hi> to whole <hi>Cities, Provinces</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms?</hi> And such Benefactors are they who instil good Principles into those, upon whom so many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions do depend: On the other hand, those who debauch the minds of great Men, as <hi>Sychophants, false Informers,</hi> and <hi>Flatterers</hi> worse then both, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly do, are the <hi>Center of all the Curses</hi> of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Men who do not only infuse deadly Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into the <hi>Cestern</hi> of a private <hi>House,</hi> but into
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46331:190"/> the public Springs of which so many Thousands are to Drink. The People therefore thought it sufficient punishment for the hangers on of <hi>Callias,</hi> to have that biting Poet <hi>Eupolis</hi> expose them in his Comedies: But as for the Favorites of those excreable Tyrants, <hi>Apollodorus, Phalaris,</hi> and <hi>Dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius,</hi> they rack'd them, they fleed them alive, they roasted them in slow Fires, they looked on them as the very Pests of <hi>Society</hi> and Disgraces of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> for to debauch a simple Person is indeed an ill thing, but <hi>to corrupt a Prince is an infinite Mischief:</hi> In like manner, he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs an ordinary Man, makes him to pass his Life decently and with comfort, but he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs a Prince, by correcting his Errors and clearing his understanding, is a <hi>Philosopher for the publick,</hi> by rectifying the very moul and model by which whole Nations are form'd and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. It is the custom of all Nations to pay a peculiar honour and deference to their <hi>Priests,</hi> and the reason of it is, because they do not only pray for good things for themselves, their own Families and Friends, but for <hi>whole Communities,</hi> for the whole state of Mankind, yet we are not so fond as to think that the Priests, make the Gods <hi>givers of good things,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire a Vein of beneficence into them, but only make their supplications to a being, which of <hi>its self</hi> is inclinable to answer their requests; but in this a good Tutor hath the Priviledge above the Priests, he effectually renders a Prince more disposed to Actions of Justice, of Moderation and Mercy, and therefore hath a greater satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Mind, when he reflects upon it.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I cannot but think that an ordinary Mecanick, for instance, a Maker of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46331:190"/> Musical Instruments, would be much more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive and pleased at his work, if his Harp were to be <hi>touched</hi> by the famous <hi>Amphion,</hi> and in his hand to serve for the <hi>Builder</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or if that <hi>Thaletas</hi> the <hi>Candidate</hi> had bespoke it, who was so great a <hi>Master,</hi> that by the force of his Musick he pacified a popular tumult amongst the <hi>Lacaedemonians.</hi> A good natured Shipwright would ply his work more heartily, if he were to make the <hi>Steerage</hi> for the <hi>Admiral Galley</hi> of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles,</hi> when he fought for the liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi> or of <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he went on his expedition against the <hi>Pirates,</hi> what exstacy of delight then must a Philosopher be in when he reflects, that his <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> is a Man of Authority, a Prince or great Potentate, that he is employ'd in so publick a work, giving <hi>Laws</hi> to him who is to give Laws to a whole Nation, who is to punish Vice, and to reward the Vertuous, with Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? The Builder of the <hi>Argos</hi> certainly would have been mightily pleased, if he had know what <hi>Noble Mariners</hi> were to row in his Ship, and that at last she should be <hi>Translated</hi> into <hi>Heaven;</hi> and a Smith would not be half so much pleased to make the Iron-work for a Coach, as to beat out the Plates on which <hi>Solons Laws</hi> were to be engrav'd. In like manner the Discourses and Rules of Philosophy being once deeply stamp'd and imprinted on the Minds of great Personages, will stick so close, that the Prince shall seem no other then <hi>Justice Incarnate</hi> and <hi>Animated</hi> Law: This was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Voyage into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he hoped that the Lectures of his Philosophy would serve for Laws to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and bring his affairs into a good posture: But the Soul of that unfortunate Prince was like Paper <hi>Scribled</hi> all over with the

                  <hi>Characters</hi> of Vice, it's piercing and corroding quality had <hi>stained</hi> quite through, and sunk into the very <hi>substance</hi> of his Soul: In such Cases, it is the best course to <hi>give them over</hi> betimes; for it is a great Truth, that <hi>Vice hath its certain Period, after which it becomes desperate and incurable.</hi>

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46331:193"/> him <hi>Archias,</hi> when free from Business, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort with the Youth of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and sit and hear with a great deal of delight; being better pleased to see us mind Philosophy and Learning than their illegal Actions: Now the same day, in which about night it was agreed that the Exiles should come privately to Town, a Messenger whom none of us all but <hi>Charon</hi> knew, came from them by <hi>Pherenicus</hi>'s order, and told us, <hi>That twelve, the youngest of the Exiles were now hunting on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Cytharon, <hi>and designed to come at night; and that he was sent to deliver this, and know in whose House they should be received; that as soon as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred they might go directly thither?</hi> This startling us, <hi>Charon</hi> put an end to all our doubts by offering to receive them in his House: With this Answer the Messenger returned: But <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer grasping me by the Hand, and looking on <hi>Charon</hi> that went just before us, said, <hi>That</hi> Charon, Cephisias, <hi>is no Philosopher, nor so general, nor so acute a Scholar as thy Brother</hi> Epaminondas, <hi>and yet you see that nature leading him, under the direction of the Law, to noble Actions, he willingly ventures on the greatest danger for the benefit of his Country; but</hi> Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, <hi>who knows more of Vertue than any of the</hi> Baeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>is dull and unactive; and though opportunity presents, though there cannot be a fairer occasion, and though he is fitted to embrace it, yet he refuseth to joyn, and will not make one in this generous attempt.</hi> And I reply'd, <hi>Courageous</hi> Theocritus, <hi>we do, what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mature deliberation we have approved; but</hi> Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas <hi>being of a contrary opinion, and thinking it better not to take this course, rationally complies with his Judgment, whilst he refuseth to meddle in those matters which his Reason upon our desire cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and to which his Nature is averse.</hi> Nor can
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46331:193"/> I think it prudent to force a Physician to use the Cupping-glass, and Lance, that promiseth to Cure the Disease without them. <hi>What</hi> (said <hi>Theocritus,) doth not he approve of our method? No,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>he would have no Citizen put to death without a Tryal at Law; but if we would endeavour to free our Country without Slaughter and Bloodshed, none would more readily comply; but since we slight his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and follow our own Course, he desires to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to be guiltless of the Blood and slaughter of his Citizens, and to be permitted to watch an opportunity when he might deliver his Country according to equity and right: For this action may go too far;</hi> Phereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, <hi>'tis true, and</hi> Pelopidas <hi>may assault the bad Men, and the oppressours of the People; but</hi> Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas <hi>and</hi> Samiadas, <hi>Men of extraordinary heat and violence, prevailing in the night, will hardly sheath their Swords till they have filled the whole City with Slaughter, and cut in pieces many of the chief Men.</hi> This Discourse of mine to <hi>Theocritus, Anaxidorus</hi> overhearing (for he was just by) bad us be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, for <hi>Archias</hi> with <hi>Lysanoridas</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> were coming from the Castle directly toward us: Upon this Advice we left off; and <hi>Archias</hi> calling <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> aside together with <hi>Lysanoridas,</hi> privately discours'd him a long while, so that we were very much afraid, lest they had some suspition or notice of our Design, and examined <hi>Theocritus</hi> about it: In the mean time, <hi>Phyllidas, (Archidamus,</hi> you know him) who was then Secretary to <hi>Archias</hi> the General, who knew of the Exiles coming, and was one of the Associates, taking me by the Hand, as he used to do, before the Company found fault with the late Exercises, and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he had seen; but afterward leading me aside, he enquired after the Exiles, and askt whether
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46331:194"/> they were resolved to be punctual at the day. And upon my assuring that they were, then he reply'd, I have very luckily provided a Feast to day to treat <hi>Archias,</hi> make him drunk, and then deliver him an easy Prey to the Invaders: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently contriv'd <hi>Phyllidas,</hi> said I, and prethee endeavour to draw all, or most of our Enemies together: That, said he, is very hard, nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impossible: For <hi>Archias</hi> being in hopes of the Company of some Noble-woman there, will not yield that <hi>Leontidas</hi> should be present, so that 'twill be necessary to divide the Associates into two Companies, that we might surprize both the Houses: For <hi>Archias</hi> and <hi>Leontidas</hi> being taken off, I suppose the others will presently fly, or staying make no stir, being very well satisfi'd if they can be permitted to be safe and quiet: So, said I, we will order it; but about what, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are they discoursing with <hi>Theocritus?</hi> And <hi>Phillidas</hi> reply'd, I cannot certainly tell, but I have heard that some Omens and Oracles portend great Disasters, and Calamities to <hi>Sparta;</hi> and perhaps they consult him about those matters: <hi>Theocritus</hi> had just left them, when <hi>Phidolaus</hi> the <hi>Haliartian</hi> meeting us, said, <hi>Simmias</hi> would have you stay here a little while, for he is interceding with <hi>Peontedas</hi> for <hi>Amphitheus,</hi> and begs that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of dying, according to the sentence, he might be banish'd: Well, said <hi>Theocritus,</hi> this happens very opportunely, for I had a mind to ask what was seen, and what found in <hi>Alcmena</hi>'s Tomb lately open'd amongst you, for perhaps, Sir, you was present when <hi>Agesilaus</hi> sent to fetch the Relicks to <hi>Sparta:</hi> And <hi>Phidolaus</hi> reply'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I was not present at the opening of the Grave, for I was not delegated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46331:194"/> extreamly concern'd, and very angry with my fellow Citizens for permitting it to be done; there was found some Relicks of a Body, a small brazen Bracelet, and to earthen Pipkins full of Earth, which now by length of time was grown very hard and petrify'd; upon the Monument there was a brazen Plate full of strange, because very ancient, Letters, for though, when the Plate was washt all the stroaks were very easily perceived; yet no body could make any thing of them; for they were a particular, barbarous, and very like the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Character: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Agesilaus</hi> (as the story goes) sent a transcript of them to the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> desiring him to shew them to the Priests, and if they understood them, to send him the meaning and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But perhaps in this matter <hi>Simmias</hi> can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, for at that time he studied their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and frequently convers'd with the Priests upon that account: The <hi>Haliartii</hi> believe the great scarcity, and overflowing of the Pool that follow'd, were not effects of chance, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgment upon them for permitting the Grave to be opened: And <hi>Theocritus</hi> after a little pause, said, nay, there seem some Judgments to hang over the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> themselves, as those Omens, about which <hi>Lysanoridas</hi> just now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd me, portend: And now he is gone to <hi>Haliartus</hi> to fill up the Grave again, and as the Oracle directs, to make some oblations to <hi>Alcmena</hi> and <hi>Aleus,</hi> but who this <hi>Aleusis,</hi> he cannot tell: And as soon as he returns, he must endeavour to find the Sepulcher of <hi>Dirce,</hi> which not one of the <hi>Thebans</hi> themselves, besides the Captains of the Horse, know; for he that goes out of his Office, leads his Successor to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46331:195"/> the place alone, and in the dark, there they offer some Sacrifices, but without fire, and leaving no mark behind them, separate from one another, and come home again in the dark: So that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Philodaus,</hi> 'twill be no easie matter for him to discover it: For most of those that have been duly elected to that Office, are now in Exile, nay, all beside <hi>Gorgidas</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and they will never ask those, for they are afraid of them: And our present Officers are invested in the Castle with the Spear only, and the Seal; but know nothing of the Tomb, and cannot direct him: Whil'st <hi>Theocritus</hi> was speaking, <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Friends went out, and we going in, saluted <hi>Simmias</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his Couch; and very much troubled, because his Petition was deny'd: He looking up upon us, cry'd out, <hi>Good God! The savage Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of these Men!</hi> And was it not an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of <hi>Thales,</hi> who when his Friends askt him, upon his return from his long Travels, <hi>What strange news he brought home,</hi> reply'd; <hi>I have seen a Tyrant an old Man: For even he that hath received no particular injury, yet disliking their stiff Pride, and haughty Carriage, becomes an Enemy to all lawless and unaccountable Powers: But Heaven perhaps will take these things into consideration: But,</hi> Cephisias, <hi>do you know that stranger that came lately hither, and who he is?</hi> And I reply'd, <hi>I do not know whom you mean; Why,</hi> said he, <hi>Leontidas told me that there was a man at night seen to rise out of</hi> Lysias <hi>his Tomb, with a great many Carriages, and a long train of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and that he had lodg'd there all night upon Beds made of leaves and boughs; for the next morning such were discovered there, with some relicks of burnt Sacrifices, and some milk oblations; and that in the Morning he inquir'd of every one he met, where</hi> Polym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<hi>'s
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46331:195"/> Sons liv'd? I wonder,</hi> said I, <hi>who 'tis, for by your description I guess him to be no mean Man:</hi> Well, said <hi>Phidolaus,</hi> when he comes, we will entertain him, but at the present, <hi>Simmias,</hi> if you know any thing more of those letters about which we were talking, pray let's have it; for 'tis said that the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests took into consideration the writing of a certain Table, which <hi>Agesilaus</hi> had from us, when he opened <hi>Alcmena</hi>'s Tomb: As for the Table, reply'd <hi>Simmias,</hi> I know nothing of it; but <hi>Agetoridas</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> came to <hi>Memphis</hi> with Letters from <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to <hi>Conouphis</hi> the Priest, whil'st I, <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ellopio</hi> the <hi>Preparethian</hi> study'd together at his House: He came by order of the King, who enjoyn'd <hi>Conouphis,</hi> that if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Writing, to send him the Interpretation with all speed: And he in three days study having collected all the different sorts of Characters that could be found in the old Books, wrote back to the King, and likewise told us, <hi>That the Writing injoyn'd the Greeks to institute Games in honour of the Muses: That the Characters were such as were us'd in the time of</hi> Proteus, <hi>and that</hi> Hercules <hi>the Son of</hi> Amphityo <hi>then learn'd them: And that the God by this admonished the</hi> Greeks <hi>to live peaceably, and at quiet, contend in Philosophy to the honour of the Muses, and laying aside their Arms, determin what is right and just by reason and discourse:</hi> We then thought that <hi>Conouphis</hi> spoke right, and that Opinion was confirm'd, when as we were sailing from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> about <hi>Caria,</hi> some <hi>Delians</hi> met us, who desir'd <hi>Plato,</hi> being well skill'd in Geometry, to solve an odd Oracle lately delivered by <hi>Apollo:</hi> The Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was this; <hi>Then the</hi> Delians, <hi>and all the other</hi> Greeks <hi>should enjoy some respite from their present Evils, when they had doubled the Altar at</hi> Delos:
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46331:196"/> They not comprehending the meaning of the Words: after many ridiculous endeavours (for each of the sides being doubled, they still fram'd a body, instead of twice, eight times as big) made application to <hi>Plato</hi> to clear the difficulty: He calling to mind what the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> had told him, said, That the God was merry upon the Greeks, who despis'd Learning; that he severely reflected on their Ignorance, and admonish'd them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to the deepest parts of Geometry; for this was not to be done by a dull short-sighted intellect, but one exactly skill'd in the nature and properties of Lines: It required skill to find the proportion of the two middle Lines, by which alone a body of a Cubick Figure can be doubled, all its dimensions being equally increast: that <hi>Eudoxus</hi> the <hi>Cnidian,</hi> or <hi>Elico</hi> the <hi>Cyzicenian</hi> might do this for them, but that was not the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd by the God, for by this Oracle he enjoyn'd all the <hi>Greeks</hi> to leave of War and Contention, and apply themselves to study, and by Learning and Arts moderating the Passions, live peaceably with one another, and profit the Community: Whil'st <hi>Simmias</hi> was speaking, my Father <hi>Polymnis</hi> came in, and sitting down by him, said, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> desires you and the rest of the Company, unless some urgent business requires your attendance, to stay for him here a little while, designing to bring you acquainted with this stranger, who is a very worthy Man, and the design upon which he comes, is very genteil and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: He is a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> of the <hi>Italian</hi> Sect, and comes hither to make some offerings to old <hi>Lysis</hi> at his Tomb, according to divers Dreams, and very notable appearances that he hath seen: He hath brought a good sum of Money with him,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46331:196"/> and thinks himself bound to satisfie <hi>Epaminondas</hi> for keeping <hi>Lysis</hi> in his old Age; and is very eager, though we are neither willing, nor desire him, to relieve his Poverty: And <hi>Simmias</hi> glad at this news, reply'd, you tell me, Sir, of a wonderful Man, and worthy Professor of Philosophy: but why doth he not come directly to us? I think, said my Father, he lay all Night at <hi>Lysis</hi> his Tomb, and therefore <hi>Epaminondas</hi> hath now led him to <hi>Ismenias</hi> to wash, and when that's done, they will be here: For before he came to our House, he logd'd at the Tomb, intending to take up the Relicks of the Body, and transport them into <hi>Italy,</hi> if some Genius at Night had not advis'd him to forbear: As soon as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ended this discourse, <hi>Galaxidorus</hi> cry'd out, Good Gods, how hard a matter is it to find a Man pure from Vanity and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For some are betray'd into those fooleries by their ignorance and weakness, others, that they may be thought extraordinary Men, and favourites of Heaven, refer all their Actions to some Divine admonition, pretending Dreams, Visions, and the like surprizing fooleries for every thing they do: This method indeed is advantageous to those that intend to settle a Common-wealth, or are forc't to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up against a rude and ungovernable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, for by this Bridle of Superstition they might manage, and reform the vulgar, but these pretences seem not only unbecoming Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, but quite opposite to all those fine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises it makes; for that having promis'd to teach us by reason what is good and profitable, falling back again to the Gods as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all our Actions, seems to despise reason, and disgrace that demonstration which is its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46331:197"/> glory; and relies on Dreams and Visions; In which the worst of Men are oftentimes as happy as the best: And therefore your <hi>Socrates, Simmias,</hi> in my opinion, follow'd the most Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical and rational method of Instructions, choosing that plain and easy way as the most genteil, and friendly unto truth, and scattering all those vain pretences which are as it were the smoak of Philosophy, to the Sophisters of the Age: And <hi>Theocritus</hi> taking him up, said, What <hi>Galaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> and hath <hi>Melitus</hi> persuaded you that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> contemn'd all Divine things, for that was part of his Accusation: Divine things by no means, reply'd <hi>Galaxidorus;</hi> but he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy full of Dreams, Fables, and Superstitions, and perfect raving; endeavour'd to bring Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Things together, and make Truth consist with sober sense: Be it so rejoyn'd <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> but what shall we think of <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon?</hi> Was it a meer juggle? For, in my mind, as <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Minerva</hi> to stand by <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> in all dangers; so the <hi>Daemon</hi> joyn'd to <hi>Socrates</hi> even from his Cradle some Vision to guide him in all the Actions of his life; which going before him, shed a light upon hidden and obscure Matters, and such as could not be discovered by unassist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humane understanding; of such things the <hi>Daemon</hi> often discours'd with him, presiding over, and by Divine instinct directing his intentions. More and greater things perhaps you may learn from <hi>Simmias,</hi> and other Companions of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but once when I was present, as I went to <hi>Euthyphron</hi>'s the Soothsayer, it happened <hi>Simmias,</hi> (for you remember it) that <hi>Socrates</hi> walkt up to <hi>Androcides</hi> his House, all the way asking questions, and jocosely perplexing <hi>Euthyphron:</hi> When standing still upon a sudden, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46331:197"/> persuading us to do the like, he mus'd a pretty while, and then turning about, walkt through <hi>Trunk-makers</hi> Street, calling back his Friends that walkt before him, affirming that it was his <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> will and admonition: Many turn'd back, amongst whom I holding <hi>Euthyphron</hi> was one; but some of the Youths keeping on the straight way, on purpose as 'twere to confute <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon,</hi> took along with them <hi>Charillus</hi> the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who came into my Company to <hi>Athens</hi> to see <hi>Cebes.</hi> Now as they were walking through <hi>Gravers-row,</hi> near the <hi>Guild hall,</hi> a Herd of dirty Swine met them, and being too many for the Street, and running against one another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw some that could not get out of the way, and dirted others; and <hi>Charillus</hi> came home with his Legs and Cloaths very dirty; so that now and then in merryment they would think on <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon,</hi> wondring that it never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the Man, and that Heaven took such particular care of him. Then <hi>Galaxidorus:</hi> and do you think, <hi>Theocritus,</hi> that <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon</hi> has some peculiar, and extraordinary Power? and that it was not some part of the common necessity that by Experience confirmed this Man, and made him in all obscure and in evident matters add some weight to the reason that was on one side? For as one grain doth not incline the Ballance by it self, yet added to one of two weights that are of equal poise, makes the whole incline to that part; thus an Omen, or the like sign, tho of it self too light to draw a grave and settled resolution to any Action, yet two equal reasons drawing on either side, when that is added to one, the doubt together with the equality is taken off, so that a motion
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46331:198"/> and inclination to the side is presently produced: Then my Father continuing the Discourse, <hi>said,</hi> You, your self, <hi>Galaxidorus,</hi> have heard a <hi>Megarian,</hi> who had it from <hi>Terpsion,</hi> sav, That <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Daemon</hi> was nothing else but the sneezing either of himself, or others; for if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sneez'd either before, behind him, or on his Right-hand, then he pursued his design, and went on to Action, but if on the Left-hand, he desisted: One sort of Sneezing confirmed him whilst deliberating, and not fully resolved; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stopt him when already upon action; but indeed it seems strange, that if Sneezing was his only Sign, that he should not acquaint his Familiars with it, but pretend that it was a <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that incouraged or forbad him; for that this should proceed from Vanity or Conceit, is not agreeable to the veracity and simplicity of the Man, for in those we knew him to be truly great, and far above the generality of Mankind: Nor is it likely so grave and wise a Man should be disturbed at a casual sound or Sneezing, and upon that account leave off what he was about, and give over his premeditated Resolutions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all, <hi>Socrates</hi>'s resolutions seem to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vigorous and steady; as begun upon right Principles, and mature Judgment: Thus he voluntarily lived poor all his life, though he had friends that would have been very glad and very willing to relieve him; he still kept close to Philosophy notwithstanding all the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he met with; and at last when his Friends endeavoured, and very ingeniously contriv'd his escape, he would not yield to their intreaties, but met death with mirth and chearfulness, and appeared a Man of a steddy reason in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46331:198"/> extremity. And sure these are not the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Man, whose designs when once fixt could be altered by an Omen or a Sneeze; but of one, who by some more considerable guidance and impulse is directed to practise things good and excellent: Besides, I have heard, that to some of his Friends he foretold the overthrow of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Sicily:</hi> And before that time <hi>Perilampes</hi> the Son of <hi>Antipho</hi> being wounded and taken Prisoner by us in that pursuit about <hi>Delius,</hi> as soon as he heard from the Ambassadours that came from <hi>Athens,</hi> that <hi>Socrates</hi> with <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Paches</hi> fled by <hi>Rhetiste,</hi> and returned safe; he blam'd himself very much, and some of his Friends and Captains of the Companies, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him were overtaken in their flight about <hi>Parneth</hi> by our Cavalry, and slain there, for not obeying <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon,</hi> and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way which he led: And this, I believe, <hi>Simmias</hi> hath heard as well as I. Yes, reply'd <hi>Simmias,</hi> many times, and from many Persons: for upon this <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon</hi> was very much talkt of at <hi>Athens.</hi> Why then, pray <hi>Simmias,</hi> said <hi>Phidolaus,</hi> shall we suffer <hi>Galaxidorus</hi> drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to degrade so considerable a Prophetick Spirit into an Omen, or a Sneeze; which the Vulgar and Ignorants, 'tis true, merrily use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout small matters, but when any danger appears, then we find that of <hi>Euripides</hi> verified;
<q>None near the edge of Swords will mind such toys,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Galaxidorus</hi> rejoyn'd, Sir, if <hi>Simmias</hi> hath heard <hi>Socrates</hi> himself speak any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, I am very ready to hear it, and not engage you; but yet what you and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46331:199"/>
                     <hi>Polymnis</hi> have delivered I could easily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to be weak and insignificant: For as in Physick the Pulse, or a Whelk are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but small things, yet are signs of no small things to the Physician, and as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the Waves, of a Bird, or the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a thin Cloud are Signs to the Pilot of a Stormy Heaven, and troubled Sea, thus to a Prophetick Soul, a Sneeze or an Omen, though simply considered in themselves no great matter, yet may be Signs and tokens of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable impending Accidents; for every Art and Science takes care to collect many things from few, and great from small: And as one that doth not know the power of Letters, when he sees a few ill shapen stroaks, would not believe that a Man skilled in Letters could read out of them the famous Battels of the Ancients, the rise of Cities, the Acts and Calamities of Kings, and assert that somthing like those matters of which he read, told him the particulars; would by this ignorance of his raise a great deal of Mirth and Laughter in the Company: So let us consider, whether or no we our selves being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of every ones power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination by which he guesseth at what is to come, are not foolishly concerned, when 'tis asserted that a wise Man by that discovers some things obscure and inevident in themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, forsooth, he himself declares that 'tis not a Sneeze or Voice, but a <hi>Daemon,</hi> that leads him on to Action: This, <hi>Polymnis,</hi> particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects you, who cannot but wonder that <hi>Socrates,</hi> a Man by Meekness, Humility, and Philosophy exalted above the common rank of Mankind, should not call this sign a Sneeze or a Voice, if
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46331:199"/> it were so, but very pretendingly a <hi>Daemon,</hi> when on the contrary, I should have wondred if a Man so critical and exact in Discourse, and so good at Names, as <hi>Socrates,</hi> should have said, that it was a Sneeze, and not a <hi>Daemon</hi> that gave him intimation; as much as if any one should say, that he is wounded by a Dart, and not with a Dart by him that threw it; for any effect is not the effect of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of that whose the Instrument is, and which useth it to that effect; and a sign is an Instrument which he that conjectures by it useth to that conjecture: But as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if <hi>Simmias</hi> hath any thing about this matter, let us quietly attend; for no doubt he must have a more perfect knowledge of the thing. Content, said <hi>Theocritus,</hi> but let us first see who these are that are coming, for I think I see <hi>Epaminondas</hi> bringing in the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon this Motion; looking toward the Door, we saw <hi>Epaminondas</hi> with his friend <hi>Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidorus, Bachylidas,</hi> and <hi>Melissus</hi> the Musician leading the way; and the Stranger following, a Man of no mean presence, his Meekness and good Nature appeared in his looks, and his dress grave and becoming: He being seated next <hi>Simmias,</hi> my Brother next me, and the rest as they pleased, and all silent; <hi>Simmias</hi> speaking to my Brother said, Well <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> by what Name and Title must I salute this Stranger, for those are commonly our first Complements, and the beginning of our better Acquaintance? And my Brother reply'd, His name, <hi>Simmias,</hi> is <hi>Theanor,</hi> by Birth he is a <hi>Crotonian,</hi> a Philosopher by profession, no disgrace to <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s fame, for he hath taken a long Voyage from <hi>Italy</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46331:200"/> to evidence by generous Actions his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proficiency in that School. And the Stranger subjoyned: But you <hi>Epaminondas</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the performance of the best Action; for if 'tis commendable to oblige Friends, 'tis not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable to be obliged; for a benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a receiver as well as a giver by both 'tis perfected and becomes a good work: For he that refuseth to receive a Favour, as a Ball that's strook fairly to him, disgraceth it by letting it fall short of the design'd mark; and what mark are we so much pleased to hit, or vext to miss, as our kind intentions of obliging a Person that deserves a Favour? 'Tis true, when the mark is fixt, he that misseth can blame no body but himself, but he that refuseth or flys a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is injurious to the favour in not letting it attain the desired end. I have told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready what was the occasion of my Voyage, the same I would discover to all present, and make them judges in the case; for after the opposite Faction had expelled the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans,</hi> and the <hi>Cycloneans</hi> had burnt the remains of that Society in their School at <hi>Metapontum,</hi> and destroy'd all but <hi>Philolaus</hi> and <hi>Lysis,</hi> who being young and nimble scap't the flame. <hi>Philolaus</hi> flying to the <hi>Lycanians</hi> was there protected by his Friends, who rose for his defence, and over-powered the <hi>Cyclonii;</hi> but where <hi>Lysis</hi> was, for a long time no body could tell; at last <hi>Gorgidas</hi> the <hi>Leontine</hi> sailing from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> seriously told <hi>Arkesus,</hi> that he met, and discoursed <hi>Lysis</hi> at <hi>Thebes: Arkesus</hi> very desirous to see the Man, as soon as he could get a passage design'd to put to Sea himself; but age and weakness comming on, he took care that <hi>Lysis</hi> should be brought to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46331:200"/>
                     <hi>Italy</hi> alive, if possible, but if not, the Relicks of his Body: The intervening Wars, Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Seditions hindered his Friends from doing it whilst he lived; but since dead <hi>Lysi</hi>'s Daemon hath made very frequent and very plain discoveries to us of his death; and many that were very well acquainted with the matter told us how courteously you received, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy entertained him; how in your poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he was allowed a plentiful Subsistance for his age; counted a Son, and dy'd in Peace; I a Young Man, and but one single Person, was sent by many and my Elders; by the wealthy to those that want; and by those that offer Money, and require no returns, but friendship and good will. <hi>Lysis,</hi> 'tis true, is buried nobly, and your respect which is more honourable than a Monument, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and requited by his familiars and his Friends: When the Stranger had said this, my Father wept a considerable time in memory of <hi>Lysis;</hi> but my Brother, as he us'd to do, smiling upon me, said, What do we do <hi>Caphisias?</hi> we give up our Poverty to Wealth, and yet are silent: By no means, I reply'd, let us part with our Old Friend, and the excellent breeder of our Youth; but defend her cause, for you are to manage it: And my Father put in, indeed I feared that <hi>Caphisias</hi> his Body would have assisted Wealth, and given it possession of my House, for that wants fine Attire, that he might appear gay and gaudy to his numerous company of Lovers; and great supplys of Food, that he might be strong to endure Wrestling, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excercises of the Ring: But since he doth not give up Poverty, since, like a Colour, he doth
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46331:201"/> not lose his hereditary want, since he, a Youth, prides himself in meanness, and is very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his present State, what need have we, and what shall we do with Wealth? <hi>Caphisias</hi> subjoyn'd, shall we guild our Arms? Shall we (as <hi>Nicias</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi>) adorn our Shield with Gold, Purple, and other gaudy variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and buy for you, Sir, a <hi>Melisian</hi> Cloak, and for my Mother a Purple Gown? for I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we shall not consume any upon our Belly, or feast more sumptuously than we did before, treating this Wealth as a Guest of Quality and Honour! Away, away Son, reply'd my Father, let me never see such a change in our course of living: Well, said <hi>Caphisias,</hi> we would not ly lazily at home, and watch over our unemploy'd Riches: for then the bestowers kindness would be a trouble, and the Possession infamous. What need then, said my Father, have we of Wealth? Upon this account, said <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> when <hi>Jason</hi> the <hi>Thessalanian</hi> General lately sent me a great sum of Money, and desired me to accept it, I was thought rude and unmannerly for telling him, that he was a Knave for endeavouring whilst he himself loved Monarchy, to bribe one of Democratical Principles, and a Member of a Free State. Your good-will, Sir, (addressing to the Stranger) for 'tis generous, and worthy a Philosopher, I accept, and passionately admire; but you offer Physick to your Friends, who are in perfect health: If upon a Report that we were distress'd and over-powered you had brought Men and Arms to our assistance, but being arrived, had found all in quietness and peace; I am certain you would not have thought it necessary to have left those supplies which we
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46331:201"/> did not then stand in need of: Thus since now you came to assist us against Poverty, as if we had been distressed by it; and find it very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and our familiar inmate, there is need to leave any Money or Arms to suppress that, which gives us no trouble or disturbance. But tell your Acquaintance, that they use Riches well, and have Friends here that use Poverty as well. What was spent in keeping and burying <hi>Lysis, Lysis</hi> himself hath sufficiently repaid, by many profitable Instructions, and by teaching us not to think Poverty a grievance. What then, said <hi>Theanor,</hi> is it mean to think Poverty a grievance? Is it not absurd to fly and be afraid of Riches, if no reason, but an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical pretence, narrowness of Mind, or Pride prompts him to reject the offer? And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I wonder would refuse such advantageous and creditable enjoyments, as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> now doth? But, Sir, (for your answer to the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> about this matter, shews you very ready) pray answer me, do you think it commendable in some cases to give Money; but always unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to receive it? Or are the givers and receivers equally guilty of a fault? By no means, reply'd <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> but as of any thing else, so the giving and receiving of Money is sometimes commendable, and sometimes base. Well then, said <hi>Theanor</hi> if a Man gives willingly what he ought to give, is not that Action commendable in him? Yes: And when 'tis commendable in one to give, is it not as commendable in another to receive? Or can a Man more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly accept a Gift from any one than from him that honestly bestows? No. Well then, <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> suppose of two Friends, one hath a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46331:202"/> Mind to present, the other must accept: 'Tis true, in a Battel we should avoid that Enemy from whom good turns have been formerly received, but in Civilities, we should neither fly, nor thrust back that Friend that makes a kind and genteil offer: And though poverty is not so grievous, yet on the other side, wealth is not so mean and desplicable a thing. Very true, replied <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> but you must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we have many lusts and desires, and the Objects of those desires many: Some are called Natural, these proceed from the very constitution of our Body, and tend to natural pleasures; others are acquired, and rise from vain opinions and mistaken notions; yet these by the length of time, ill habits, and bad Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are usually improved, get strength, and debase that Soul more than the other natural and necessary Passions. By custom and care any one with the assistance of reason may free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from many of his natural desires: But Sir, all our Arts, all our Force of Discipline must be imploy'd against the superfluous, and acquired appetites; and they must be restrained or cut off by the guidance, or edge of Reason: For if the contratry applications of Reason can make us forbear Meat and Drink, when hungry or thirsty, how much more easy is it to conquer Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Ambition, which will be destroy'd by a bare restraint from their proper objccts, and a non-attainment of their desired end: And. pray, Sir, are not you of the same opinion? Yes, replied the Stranger. Then, Sir, continued <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> don't you perceive a difference between the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it self, and the Work to which the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise relates? For instance, in a Wrestler, the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46331:202"/> Work is the striving with his adversary for the Crown, the Exercise is the preparation of his Body by Diet, Wrestling, or the like: So in Virtue, you must confess the work to be one thing, and the Exercise another. Very well, replied the Sranger: Then continued <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> let us first examine whether to abstain from base unlawful pleasures is the exercise only of Continence, or the Work, and evidence of that Exercise? The very Work and Evidence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Stranger; but the Exercise of it is not such as you practice, when after Wrestling, where you have raised your Appetites like ravenous Beasts, you stand a long while at a Table covered with plenty and variety of Meats, and then give it to your Servants to feast on whilst you offer mean and spare Diet to your subdued Appetites; for abstinence from lawful pleasures is exercise against unlawful. Very well, replied the Stranger. So, continued <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> Justice is Exercise against Covetousness and love of Money; but so is not a meer cessation from stealing or robbing our Neighbour: So he that doth not betray his Country or Friends for Gold, doth not exercise against Covetousness (for the Law perhaps deteterrs, and fear restrains him) but he that refuseth just gain, and such as the Laws allows, voluntarily exercises, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures himself from being brib'd or receiving any unlawful present; for when great, hurtful, and base pleasures are proposed, 'tis very hard for any one to contain, that hath not often despised those which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad power and opportunity to enjoy: Thus when base Bribes and considerable advantages are offered, 'twill be difficult to refuse, unless he hath long ago rooted out all thoughts
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46331:203"/> of Gain, and love of Money; for other desires will nourish and increase that Appetite, and he will easily be drawn to any unjust Action, who can scarce forbear reaching out his hand to a proffered present; but he that will not lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self open to the favours of Friends, the Gifts of Kings, but refuseth even what Fortune Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and keeps off his Appetite that is eager after, and as it were, leaps forward to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing treasure, is never disturbed, or tempted to unlawful Actions, but hath great and brave thoughts, and hath command over himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscious of none but generous designs: I and <hi>Cepheisias,</hi> dear <hi>Simmias,</hi> being passionate of admirers of such Men beg the Stranger to suffer us to be taught and exercised by Poverty to attain that height of Vertue and perfection.</p>
                  <p>My Brother having finished this Discourse, <hi>Simmias</hi> nodding twice or thrice, said, <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> is a great, a great Man, but this <hi>Polymnis</hi> is the cause of his greatness, who gave his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the best Education, and bred them Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers: But, Sir, you may end this Dispute at leasure among your selves: As for <hi>Lysis</hi> (if 'tis lawful to discover it) pray, Sir, do you design to take him out of his Tomb, and transport him into <hi>Italy,</hi> or leave him here amongst this Friends and Acquaintance, who shall be glad to ly by him in the Grave? And <hi>Theanor</hi> with a smile answered, <hi>Lysis,</hi> good <hi>Simmias,</hi> no doubt is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleas'd with the place, for <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> supply'd him with all things necessary and fitting: But the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> have some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Funeral Ceremonies, which, if any one wants, we conclude he did not make a proper and happy Exit: Therefore as soon as we
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46331:203"/> learnt from some Dreams that <hi>Lysis</hi> was dead (for we have certain marks to know the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of the living from the Images of the dead) most began to think that <hi>Lysis</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a strange Countrey was not interr'd with the due Ceremonies, and therefore was to be remov'd to <hi>Italy</hi> that he might receive them there: I coming upon this design, and being by the People of the Country directed to the Tomb, in the Evening poured out my Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and call'd upon the Soul of <hi>Lysis</hi> to come out, and direct me in this Affair: The Night drawing on, I saw nothing indeed, but thought I heard a voice saying, <hi>Move not those Relicks that ought not to be mov'd, for</hi> Lysis <hi>his Body was duly and religiously interr'd; and his Soul is sent to inform another Body, and committed to the care of another Daemon:</hi> And early this Morning asking <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> about the manner of <hi>Lysis</hi> his burial, I found that <hi>Lysis</hi> had taught him as far as the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Mysteries of our Sect; and that the same <hi>Daemon</hi> that waited on <hi>Lysis</hi> presided over him, if I can guess at the Pilot from the sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ship: The paths of Life are large, but in few are Men directed by the <hi>Daemons:</hi> When <hi>Theanor</hi> had said this he lookt attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> as if he design'd a fresh search into his nature, and inclinations.</p>
                  <p>At the same instant the Chirurgion coming in unbound <hi>Simmias</hi> his Leg, and prepar'd to dress it; and <hi>Phyllidas</hi> entring with <hi>Hippostheneides</hi> extreamly concern'd, as his very Countenance discover'd, desir'd me, <hi>Charon,</hi> and <hi>Theocritus</hi> to withdraw into a private Corner of the Porch: And I asking <hi>Phyllidas,</hi> hath any new thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd? Nothing new to me, he reply'd, for I
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46331:204"/> knew, and told you, that <hi>Hippostheneides</hi> was a Coward, and therefore beg'd you not to communicate the matter to him, or make him an Associate: We seeming all surpriz'd, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postheneides</hi> cry'd out, for Heaven's sake <hi>Phyllidas,</hi> don't say so, don't think rashness to be bravery, and blinded by that mistake ruine both us and the Commonwealth, but (if it must be so) let the Exiles return again in peace: And <hi>Phyllidas</hi> in Passion reply'd, how many, <hi>Hippostheneides,</hi> do you think are privy to this design? Thirty I know engag'd: And why then continued <hi>Phylli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> would you singly oppose your Judgment th them all; and ruine those measures they had all taken and agreed to?

These words of <hi>Phyllidas</hi> troubled every one, and <hi>Charon</hi> looking very angrily upon <hi>Hipostheneides,</hi> said, Thou Coward! what hast thou done? No harm, reply'd <hi>Hippostheneides,</hi> as I'le make appear, if you will moderate your passion, and hear what your gray-headed equal can alledge: If <hi>Phyllidas,</hi> we were minded to shew our Citizens a Brave that sought danger, and a Heat that contemn'd Life, there is day enough before us, why should we wait till the Evening? Let us take our Swords presently, and assault the Tyrants: Let us kill, let us be kill'd, and be prodigal of our Bood: if this may be easily perform'd or endur'd, and if 'tis no easy matter by the loss of two or three Men to free <hi>Thebes</hi> from so great an armed power as possesses it, and to beat out the <hi>Spartan</hi> Garrison (for I suppose <hi>Phillidas</hi> hath not provided Wine enough

For why else should the <hi>Thespienses</hi> for these three days, be commanded to be in Arms, and follow the orders of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals? and I hear, that to day, after Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before <hi>Archias,</hi> when he returns, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to put <hi>Amphitheus</hi> to death; and are not these strong proofs that our conspiracy is discover'd?

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46331:205"/> and that fear encreast when I heard that the Exiles intended to come to day to your House, and I am very much afraid that we shall bring mighty mischiefs on our selves, yet do our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies no proportionable harm, but only give them a little disturbance; for, I think the City signifies <hi>us,</hi> and the Castle, as 'tis now in their Power, <hi>them:</hi> Then <hi>Theocritus</hi> putting in, and injoyning <hi>Charon,</hi> who was eager to reply, silence, said, As for my part <hi>Hippostheneides,</hi> though all my Sacrifices were of good Omen to the Exiles, yet I never found any greater inducement to go on, then the Dream you mention'd; for you say that a great and bright fire rising out of a Friends House caught the City; and that the Habitation of the Enemies was blackned with Smoak, which never brings any thing better than Tears and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; that in articulate sounds broke out from us, shews that none shall make clear and full discovery; only a blind suspicion shall arise, and our design shall appear, and have its desir'd effect at the same time, and the Ominous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices do not respect the Publick but the Men in Power: Whilst <hi>Theocritus</hi> was speaking, I said to <hi>Hipostheneides,</hi> Whom did you employ in this Message? for if it was not long ago we will follow him? Indeed <hi>Cepheisias,</hi> he reply'd, 'tis unlikely (for I must tell the truth) that you should overtake him, for he is upon the best Horse in <hi>Thebes:</hi> You all know the Man, he is Master of the Horse to <hi>Melon,</hi> and <hi>Melon</hi> from the very beginning hath made him privy to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign: And I observing him to be at the Door, said; What <hi>Hipostheneides</hi> is it <hi>Clido,</hi> he that last year at <hi>Juno</hi>'s feast wan the single Horse-race?

At this <hi>Hippostheneides</hi> turning about, cry'd out, <hi>Clido,</hi> by <hi>Hercules,</hi> I'le lay my life some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky accident hath happened: <hi>Clido</hi> observing that we took notice of him, came softly from the Gate towards us, and <hi>Hippostheneides</hi> giving him a nod, and bidding him deliver his Message to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for they were all sure friends, and and privy to the whole Plot, he began, Sir, I know the Men very well, and not finding you either at home, or in the Market-place, I guess'd you were with them, and came directly hither to give you a full account of the present posture of Affairs: You commanded me with all possible speed to meet the Exiles upon the Mountain, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I went home to take Horse; and call'd for my Bridle; my Wife said it was mislaid, and stay'd along time in the Hostry, tumbling about things, and pretending to look carefully after it; at last when she had tri'd my Patience, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd that her Neighbours Wife had borrow'd it last Night; this rais'd my Passion and I chid her, and she began to curse, and wisht me a bad journey, and as bad a return; all which cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, pray God, may fall upon her own head: at last my passion grew high, and I began to cudgel her, and presently the Neighbours and Women coming in, there was fine work, I am so bruis'd that 'twas as much as I could do to come hither to desire you to employ another Man, for I protest I am amaz'd, and in a very bad condition: Upon this News we were strangely alter'd, just before we were angry with the Man, that endeavour'd to put it off, and now the time approaching, the very minute just upon us, and it be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46331:207"/> how great the force of the thing conceiv'd is for the Bones that are insensible, the Nerves, the Flesh that is full of humours, and the heavy Mass compos'd of all these lying quiet and at rest, as soon as the Soul gives the impulse, and raiseth an Appetite to move toward an Object, is rous'd, invigorated, and every Member seems a Wing to carry it forward to Action: Nor is it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to conceive the manner of this motion and stirring, by which the Soul having conceiv'd any thing by her Appetites, rouseth the whole Mass; but in as much as a Speech barely apprehended without any sensible voice easily excites, so in my opinion, the understanding of a superior Nature may move the Understanding of a more Divine Soul; for reason may be apply'd to, and touch reason, as incident light the reflection of the same ray. We, 'tis true, as it were groping in the dark, find out one anothers conceptions by the voice, but the Conceptions of the <hi>Daemons</hi> carry a light with them, and shine to those that are able to perceive them, so that there is no need of words, such as Men using to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, see the images of things conceiv'd, only by Signs and Tokens; but cannot perceive the very Images, unless they enjoy a peculiar, and (as I said before) a Divine Light: This may be illustrated from the nature and effect of voice; for the Air being form'd into articulate sounds, and made all voice, transmits the Conception to the Soul of the Hearer; so that 'tis no wonder if the Air, that is very apt to take impressions, being fashioned according to the Object, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by a more excellent nature, signifies that Conception to some Divine and Extraordinary Men: For as a stroak upon a Brazen Shield,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:46331:207"/> when the noise ariseth out of a hollow, is heard only by those who are in a convenient position, and not perceiv'd by others; so the Specehes of the Daemons though apply'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all, yet only sound, to those who are of a quiet temper and sedate mind, and such as we call Holy and Divine Men: Most believe that Daemons communicate some illuminations to Men asleep; but think it strange and incredible that they should communicate the like to them whilst they are awake, and have their Senses and Reason vigorous; as wise a fancy as 'tis to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a Musician can use his Harp when the strings are slack, but cannot play when they are screw'd up and in tune; for they don't consider that the effect is hindred by the unquietness and incapacity of their own minds, from which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences our Friend <hi>Socrates</hi> was free, as the Oracle assur'd his Father whilst he was a Boy; for that commanded him to let young <hi>Socrates</hi> do what he would, not to force or draw him from his inclinations, but let the Boy's humour have its free course; that he should beg <hi>Jupiters</hi> and the Muses blessing upon him, and take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care; intimating that he had a guide to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him that was better than ten thousand Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Instructors: This <hi>Phidolaus</hi> was my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon</hi> whilst he liv'd, and since his Death, and I look upon all they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Omens, Sneezings, or the like, to be Dreams and Fooleries. But what I heard <hi>Timar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> discourse upon the same Subject, lest some should think I delight in Fables, perhaps 'tis best to conceal: By no means, cry'd <hi>Theocritus,</hi> let's have it; for though they do not perfectly agree with it, yet I know many Fables border upon
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46331:208"/> truth; but pray first tell us who this <hi>Timarchus</hi> was, for I was never acquainted with the Man. Very likely <hi>Theocritus,</hi> said <hi>Simmias,</hi> for he dy'd when he was very young, and desir'd <hi>Socrates</hi> to bury him by <hi>Lampocles, Socrates</hi> his Son, who was his dear Friend, of the same Age, and dy'd not many days before him; he being eager to know (for he was a fine Youth and a beginner in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy) what <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon</hi> was; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting none but <hi>Cebes</hi> and me with his Design, went down into <hi>Trophonius</hi>'s Cave, and perform'd all the Ceremonies that were requisite to gain an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: There he stayed two nights and one day, so that his Friends despair'd of his return, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him as lost; but the next Morning he came out with a very chearful countenance, and having ador'd the God, and freed himself from the thronging inquisitive Crowd, he told us many wonderful things that he had seen and heard; for this was his Relation; As soon as he entred, a thick darkness surrounded him, then after he had pray'd, he lay a long while upon the ground, but was not certain whether awake or in a Dream, only he imagin'd that a smart stroak fell upon his head, and that through the parted Sutures of his Skull, his Soul fled out; which being now loose, and mixt with a purer and more lightsome Air, was very jocund and well pleas'd, it seemed to begin to breath, as if till then it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most choakt, and grew bigger than before, like a Sail swoln by the wind; then he heard a small noise whirling round his head, very sweet and ravishing; and looking up he saw no Earth, but certain Islands shining with a gentle fire which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchang'd Colours according to the different va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the light; innumerable and very large;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46331:208"/> unequal, but all round: These whirling, 'tis likely, agitated the Aether, and made that sound; for the ravishing softness of it was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their even motions: Between these Islands there was a large Sea or lake which shone very gloriously, being adorn'd with a gay variety of Colours mixt with blew; some few of the Islands swam in this Sea, and were carry'd to the other side of the Current; others, and those the most, were carry'd up and down, tost, whirl'd, and almost overwhelm'd.</p>
                  <p>This Sea in some places seem'd very deep, especially toward the <hi>South,</hi> in other parts very shallow; it ebb'd and flow'd, but the Tides were neither high nor strong; in some parts its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was pure, and Sea-green; in others it lookt muddy, and as troubled as a Lake: the Current brings those Islands that were carry'd over to the other side back again; but not to the same point, so that their motions are not exactly circular, but winding: About the middle of these Islands, <hi>Ambient Sea</hi> seem'd to bend into a hollow, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle less, as it appear'd to him, than eight parts of the whole: Into this Sea were two entrances, by which it received two opposite fiery Rivers, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with so strong a current that it spre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46331:209"/> and rising through the vast hollow; and this terrify'd him exceedingly: A little while after an invisible thing spoke thus to him; Timarchus, <hi>what dost thou desire to understand?</hi> And he reply'd, <hi>Every thing;</hi> for what is there that is not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and surprising? We have little to do with those things above, they belong to other Gods; but as for <hi>Proserpina</hi>'s Quarter which being one of the four, as <hi>Styx</hi> divides them, that we govern, you may visit if you please: But what is <hi>Styx?</hi> The way to Hell, which reaches to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quarter, and with its head divides the Light; for as you see, it rises from Hell below, about which it rouls and separates the extreamest part of the Universe from the Light: There are four Divisions of all things under our Government; the first is of Life, the second of the Motion, the third of Generation, and the fourth of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: The first is coupled to the second by a Unite, in the substance invisible; the second to the third by Understanding, in the Sun; and the third to the fourth by Nature in the Moon: Over every one of these Ties Fate the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Necessity presides; over the first <hi>Atropos;</hi> over the second, <hi>Clotho;</hi> and <hi>Lachesis</hi> over the third, which is in the Moon, and about which is the whole whirl of Generation; all the other Islands have Gods in them, but the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Earthly Daemons, is rais'd but a little above <hi>Styx: Styx</hi> ceases on her once in a hundred seventy seven Revolutions; and when it approaches the Souls are startled, and cry out for fear; for Hell swallows up a great many, and the Moon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives some swimming up from below, which have run through their whole course of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unless they are wicked, and impure; for
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46331:209"/> against such she throws flashes of Lightning, makes horrible noises, and frights them away; so that missing their desired happiness, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their condition, they are carried down again (as you see) to undergo another Generation. But, said <hi>Timarchus,</hi> I see nothing but Stars leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Hollow, and some carried into it, and some shining out of it again: These, said the Voice, are Daemons; for thus 'tis; every Soul hath some portion of Reason; a Man cannot be a Man without it; but as much as she mixes with Flesh and Appetite, is chang'd; and through pain or pleasure becomes irrational; every Soul doth not mix her self alike, for some plunge themselves into the Body, and so in this Life their whole frame is corrupted by Appetite and Passion; others are mixt as to some part, but the purer part still remains without the Body; 'tis not drawn down into it, but it swims above, and touches the extreamest part of the Mans head; 'tis like a Cord to hold up, and direct the subsiding part of the Soul, as long as it proves obedient, and is not overcome by the Appetites of the Flesh: That part that is plung'd into the Body is call'd the Soul; but the uncorrupted part is call'd the Mind, and the Vulgar think 'tis within them, as likewise they imagine the Image reflected from a Glass to be in that; but the more intelligent, who know it to be without, call it a Daemon, therefore those Stars which you see extinguished, imagine to be Souls whose whole substances are plunged into Bodies; and those that recover their light, and rise from below; that shake off the ambient Mist and Darkness, as if it were Clay and Dirt; to be such as retire from their Bodies after Death; and those that are carry'd
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46331:210"/> up on high are the Daemons of Wise Men and Philosophers: But pray pry narrowly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to discover the Tye which every one is united to a Soul. Upon this <hi>Timarchus</hi> lookt as sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly as he could, and saw some of the Stars very much agitated, and some less; as the Corks upon a Net; and some whirl'd round like a Spindle, having a very irregular and uneven motion, and not being able to run in a straight Line: And thus the Voice said, those that have a straight and regular motion belong to Souls that are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable, by reason of their Gentiel Breeding, and Philosophical Education; and which upon Earth do not plunge themselves into the foul Clay, and become irrational: but those that move irrigular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sometimes upwards, sometimes downwards, as striving to break loose from a vexing Chain, are yoakt to, and strive with very untractable conditions, which ignorance and want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes head-strong and ungovernable: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they get the better of the Passions, and draw them to the right side; sometimes they are drawn away by them, and sink into sin and folly; and then again endeavour to get out, for the tye as 'twere a Bridle on the irrational part of the Soul, when 'tis pull'd back, draws in Repentance for past sins, and shame for loose and unlawful pleasures; which is a pain and stroak inflicted on the Soul by a governing and prevailing Power, till by this means it becomes gentle and manageable, and like a tam'd Beast, without blows or torment, it understands the minutest direction of the Daemon; such indeed are but very slowly very hardly brought to a right temper; but of that sort which from the very beginning are governable,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46331:210"/> and obedient to the direction of the Daemon are of those Prophetick Souls, those Intimates of the Gods. Such was the Soul of <hi>Hermodorus</hi> the <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenian,</hi> of which, 'tis reported, that for several Nights and Days it would leave his Body, travel over many Countrys, and return after it had view'd things, and discourst with Persons at a great distance; till at last, by the Treachery of a Woman, his Body was delivered to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and they burnt the House while the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant was abroad; 'tis certain, this is a meer Fable: The Soul never went out of the Body, but it loosned the tye that held the Daemon and permitted it to wander; so that, that seeing, and hearing the various external occurrences brought in the news to it; yet those that burnt his Body, are even till this time severely tormented in the deepest Pit of Hell: But this, Youth, you shall more clearly perceive three Months hence, now depart: The voice continuing no longer, <hi>Timar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> (as he said) turn'd about to discover who 'twas that spoke, but a violent pain, as if his Skull had been press'd together, seiz'd his head; so that he lost all Sense and Understanding, but in a little while recovering, he found himself in the enterance of the Cave, where he at first lay down: This was <hi>Timarchus</hi> his story, and when at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the third Month after he had heard the Voice, he dy'd; we amaz'd at the event, told <hi>Secrates</hi> the whole Tale: <hi>Socrates</hi> was angry with us for not discovering it whilst <hi>Timarchus</hi> was alive; for he would very gladly have had a more full discovery from his own Mouth: I have done <hi>Theocritus</hi> with the Story and Discourse; but pray, shall we not intreat the Stranger to discuss this point? For 'tis a very
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46331:211"/> proper Subject for Excellent and Divine Men. What then, said <hi>Theanor,</hi> shall we not have the opinion of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who is of the same School, and as well learn'd as my self in these matters? And my Father with a smile said, Sir, that his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he loves to be silent, he is very cautious how he proposeth any thing, but will hear Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and is never weary of an instructive Story: so that <hi>Spinterus</hi> the <hi>Tarentine,</hi> who liv'd with him a long time, would often say, <hi>That he never met a Man that knew more, or spake less:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, pray Sir, let us have your thoughts.

                  <p>For as those that are not near the Persons of Kings or Commanders, understand their Minds by Proclamation, sound of Trumpet, or the like; but their Favourites receive it from their own Mouth; so the Deity converses imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but with very few, and very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but to most he gives signs, from which the Art of Divination is gather'd; so that the Gods direct the lives of very few, and of such only whom they intend to raise to the highest degree of perfection and happiness: Those Souls (as <hi>Hesiod</hi> sings) that are not to be put into another Bodv, but are freed from all Union with Flesh, turn Guardian Daemons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over others; for as Wrestlers, when Old Age makes them unfit for Exercise, have some love for it still left, delight to see others wrestle, and encourage them; so Souls that have past all the Stages of Life, and by their Virtue are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted into Daemons do not slight the endeavours of Man, but being kind to those that strive for the same attainments, and joyntly endeavouring after Virtue, encourage and help them on when they see them near their hope, and ready to catch
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46331:212"/> the desir'd prize; for the Daemon doth not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with every one; but as in a Shipwrack, those that are far from Land, their Friends standing on the Shore, only look upon, and pity; but those that are near, they encourage, and wade in to save; so the Daemon deals with Mankind; whilst we are immerst in worldly Affairs, and are changing Bodies, as fit Vehicles for our conveyance, he lets us alone to try our own strength, patiently to stem the Tide, and get into the Haven by our selves, but that Soul that hath gone through the Tryals of a thousand Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and now her course is almost finisht, strives bravely, and with a great deal of toyl and labour, endeavours to ascend; the Deity permits her proper Genius, that is willing to assist: The <hi>Daemon</hi> thus permitted, presently sets about the work, and upon his approach, if the Soul obeys and hearkens to his directions, she is sav'd; if not, the <hi>Daemon</hi> leaves her, and she lies in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition.</p>
                  <p>This Discourse was just ended, when <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> looking upon me, said, <hi>Caphisias,</hi> 'Tis time for you to be at the Ring, your usual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will expect you; we as soon as we break Company will take care of <hi>Theanor:</hi> And I reply'd, Sir, I'le go presently, but I think <hi>Theocritus</hi> here hath somothing to say to you and me, and <hi>Galaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> Let's here it in Gods name, said he, and rising up, led us into a Corner of the Porch: When we had him in the midst of us, we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to desire him to make one in the Conspiracy.

<q>Come now to Supper, that we may contend:</q> And when you seem'd concern'd, and urg'd us to speak to that Head; I first reply'd, Sir, we must consider what Company we have; for if the greater part of the Guests are learned Men; as for instance, at <hi>Agatho</hi>'s Entertainment, <hi>Socrates, Phaedri, Pausaniae, Eurymachy;</hi> or at <hi>Callias</hi> his Board, <hi>Carmidae, Antisthenes, Hermogenes</hi> and the like, we will permit them to philosophize, and to mix <hi>Bacchus</hi> Wine with the Muses (Learning) as well as with the Nymphs (Water;) for the latter make him wholsome and gentle to the Body, and the other pleasant and agreeable to the Soul: And if there are some few illiterate Persons present, they, as Consonants with Vowels, in the midst of the other learned, will participate of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what an articulate Sound and signification; but if the greater part consists of such who can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endure the Noise of any Bird, Fiddle-string, or piece of Wood, than the Voice of a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: <hi>Pisistratus</hi> hath shewn us what to do; for he being at difference with his Sons, when he heard his Enemies rejoyc'd at it, in a full Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he declared, that he had endeavoured to perswade his Sons to submit to him, but since he found them obstinate, he was resolved to yield and submit to their Humors. So a Philosopher midst those Companions that slight his excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, will lay aside his Gravity, follow them, and comply with their Humor as far as Decencv will permit; knowing very well that Men cannot exercise their Rhetorick, unless they speak, but

But in this, Custom, and the established Rules of Decency must guide; or else let us abolish all those Modes of Repect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by Drinking to, or saluting first, which we do not use promiscuously to all the Company, but according to their Worth we honour every one,
<q>With better Places, Meat, and larger Cups;</q> As <hi>Agamemnon</hi> says, setting the place first, as the chiefest sign of Honour; and we commend <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinous</hi> for placing his Guest next himself;
<q>
                        <l>He stout <hi>Laomedon</hi> his Son remov'd,</l>
                        <l>Who sate next him, for him he dearly lov'd;</l>
                     </q> For to place a suppliant Stranger in the Seat of his beloved Son, was wonderful kind, and extream courteous. Nay, even amongst the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this distinction is observed, for <hi>Neptune,</hi> though he came last into the Assembly.</p>

                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:46331:223"/> And <hi>Pindar</hi> plainly says,
<q>She sits just next the Thunder-breathing Flames.</q> Indeed <hi>Timon</hi> urges, we ought not to rob many to honour one; now he robs that makes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is proper, common and suitable Honor to his Worth is each Mans Property: and whilst he endeavors not to affront his Guests, he neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily falls into the Inconvenience, for he must affront every one by defrauding them of their proper Honor. Besides, in my Opinion, 'tis no hard matter to make this Distinction, and seat our Guests according to their Quality; for first it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldom happens that many of equal Honor are invited to the same Banquet; and then, since there are many honorable Places, you have room enough to dispose them according to Content, if you can but guess that this Man must be seated uppermost, that in the middle, another next your self, Friend, Acquaintance, Tutor, or the like, appointing every one some place of Honor; and as for the rest, I would supply their Want of Honor with some little Presents, Affability, and kind Discourse. But if their Qualities are not easie to be distinguished, and the Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, hard to be pleas'd, see what Device I have in that Case; for I seat in the most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place, my Father, if invited; if not, my Grand-father, Father-in-law, Uncle, Fellow-Officer, or some body whom the Entertainer hath a more particular reason to esteem. And this is one of the many Rules of Decency that we have from <hi>Homer;</hi> for in his Poem, when <hi>Achilles</hi> saw <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Antilochus</hi> contending about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Prize of the Horse-Race, and fearing that
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46331:224"/> their Strife and Fury would encrease, gave the Prize to another, under pretence of comforting and honouring <hi>Eumelus,</hi> but indeed to take away the Cause of their Contention. When I had said this, <hi>Lamprias</hi> sitting (as he always doth) upon a low Bed, cry'd out, Sirs, will you give me leave to correct this sottish Judge? And the Company bidding him speak freely, and tell me roundly of my Faults, and not spare, he said, And who can forbear that Philosopher, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of Places at a Feast according to the Birth, Wealth, or Offices of the Guests, as if they were in a Theater or Council-house voting for a Law; so that Pride and Arrogance must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted even into our Mirth and Entertainments? In seating our Guests we should not have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Honor, but Mirth and Conversation, not look after every Mans Quality, but their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Harmony with one another, as those do that joyn several different things in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure. Thus a Mason doth not set an <hi>Athenian</hi> or a <hi>Spartan</hi> Stone, because formed in a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Country, before an <hi>Asian</hi> or a <hi>Spanish:</hi> Nor a Painter give the most costly Colour the chiefest place; nor a Ship-wright the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Firr, or <hi>Cretan</hi> Cypress; but so distribute them as they will best serve to the common end, and make the whole Composure, strong, beautiful, and fit for use. Nay, you see even the Deity himself (by our <hi>Pindar,</hi> nam'd the most skilful Artificer) doth not every where place the Fire above, and the Earth below, as <hi>Empedocles</hi> hath it,
<q>
                        <l>The Oysters Coverings do directly prove,</l>
                        <l>That heavy Earth is sometimes rais'd above.</l>

                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:46331:224"/> Not having that Place that Nature appoints, but that which is necessary to compound Bodies, and serviceable to the common end, the Preservation of the whole. Disorder is in every thing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but then its Badness is principally discovered, when 'tis amongst Men whilst they are making merry; for then it breeds Contentions, and a thousand unspeakable Mischiefs, which to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and hinder, shews a Man well skill'd in good Order, and disposing Right. We all agreed that he had said well, but ask'd him why he would not instruct us how to order things aright, and communicate his Skill; I am content, says he, to instruct you, if you will permit me to change the present Order of this Feast, and yield as ready Obedience to me as the <hi>Thebans</hi> to <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> when he alter'd the Order of their Battle: We gave him full Power, and he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turn'd all the Servants out, look'd round up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one, and said, Hear (for I'le tell you first) how I design to order you together: In my Mind, the <hi>Theban Pammenes</hi> justly taxeth <hi>Homer,</hi> as unskilful in Love Matters, for setting together, in his Description of an Army, Tribe and Tribe, Family and Family; for he should have joyn'd the Lover and the Beloved, so that the whole Body being united in their Minds, might perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree. This Rule will I follow, not seat one Rich Man by another, a Youth by a Youth, a Magistrate by a Magistrate, and a Friend by a Friend; (for such an Order is of no force, either to beget or encrease Friendship and Good-will) but fitting that that wants, with something that is able to supply it; next one that is willing to instruct, I will place one that is as desirous to be instructed, next a morose, one good natur'd,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46331:225"/> next a talkative old Man, a Youth patient; and eager for a Story; next a Boaster, a jeering swooth Companion; and next an angry Man, a quiet. If I see a wealthy Fellow bountiful and kind, I'le take some poor honest Man from his obscure place, and set him next, that something might run out of that full Vessel, into the other empty one. A Sophister I'le seat by a Sophister, and one Poet by another:
<q>For Beggers Beggers, Poets envy Poets:</q> I separate the clamorous Scoffers, and the testy, by putting some good Nature between them, that they might not justle so roughly on one another: Wrestlers, Hunters, and Farmers I put in one Company; for some of the same Nature, when put together, fight as Cocks; others are very sociable as Daws: Drinkers and Lovers I set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not only those, who (as <hi>Sophocles</hi> says) feel the Sting of Masculine Love, but those that are mad after Virgins or marry'd Women; for they being warmed with the like Fire, as two Pieces of Iron to be joyned, will more readily agree; unless perhaps they both fancy the same Person.</p>

The second, That two Beds being appointed for the invited Guests. The third, and the first place in that is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Master of the Feast, from whence, like a Pilot, he can guide and order every thing, and readily over-look the Management of the whole Affair; besides, he is not so far remov'd, but that he might easily discourse, talk to, and complement his Guests; for next below him his Wife and Children usually are plac'd; next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him the most honorable of the Invited, that being the most proper Place, as near the Master of the Feast. The third, 'Tis peculiar to this Place, to be most convenient for the Dispatch of of any sudden Business; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul is not such a one as <hi>Archias</hi> the Governor of <hi>Thebes;</hi> nor will he say, when Letters of Importance are brought to him at Dinner, serious things to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; throw aside the Pacquet, and take the

<q>Each Throw doth make the Dicer fear.</q> But even midst his Feasting and his Pleasure, a Magistrate should be intent on intervening Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and he hath this Place appointed, as the most convenient for him to receive any Message, answer it, or sign a Bill; for there the second Bed joyning with the first, the turning at the Corner leaves a vacant Space, so that a Notary, Servant or Trumpeter from the Army might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, deliver his Message and receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and the Consul having room enough to speak, or use his Hand, neither trouble any one, nor be hindred by any of the Guests.</p>

Well then, said I, since you will have it so, I make my self Steward and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of you all, and command the rest to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46331:226"/> drink every one what he will; but <hi>Crato</hi> and <hi>Theon,</hi> the first Proposors and Authors of this Decree, I injoyn to declare in short, what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications fit a Man for this Office; what he should principally aim at, and how behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self towards those under his Command: This is the Subject, and let them agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which Head each shall manage: They made some slight Excuse at first, but the whole Company urging them to obey, <hi>Crato</hi> began thus, A Captain of a Watch (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) ought to be most watchful and diligent himself; and the Director of merry Companions ought to be the best; and such a one he is that will not be easily overtaken, or apt to refuse a Glass; but as <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> says, that in many other things he was more fit than his Brother to be a King; and chiefly, because he could bear abundance of Wine: For one that is drunk must have an ill Carriage, and be apt to affront; and he that is perfectly sober, must be unpleasant, and fitter to be a Governour of a School than of a Feast: <hi>Pericles,</hi> as often as he was chosen General, when he put on his Coat, us'd to say to himself, as 'twere to refresh his Memory, <hi>Take heed</hi> Pericles, <hi>thou dost govern Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, thou dost govern</hi> Athenians: So let our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector say privately to himself, Thou art a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour over Friends; that he might remember neither to suffer them to be debauch'd, or stint their Mirth: Besides, he ought to have some Skill in the serious Studies of the Guests, and not be altogether ignorant of Mirth and Humor; yet I would have him (as pleasant Wine ought to be) a little severe and rough, for the Liquor will soften and smooth him, and make his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:46331:227"/> pleasant and agreeable: For as <hi>Xenophon</hi> says, <hi>That</hi> Clearchus <hi>his rustick and morose Humor in a Battle, by reason of his Bravery and Heat, seem'd pleasant and surprizing;</hi> thus one that is not of a very sour Nature, but grave and severe, being softned by a chirping Cup, becomes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and complaisant; but chiefly he should be acquainted with every one of the Guests Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, what alteration the Liquor makes in him, what Passion he is most subject to, and what quantity he can bear; for 'tis not to be suppos'd the different sorts of Water bear various Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to different sorts of Wine (which Kings Cup-bearers understanding, sometimes pour in more, sometimes less) and that Man hath no such relation to them; this our Director ought to know, and knowing, punctually observe; so that like a good Musician, screwing up one, and letting down another, he might make between these different Natures, a pleasing Harmony and Agreement; so that he should not proportion his Wine by measure, but give every one what was proper and agreeable, according to the present Circumstances of Time, and strength of Body: But if this is too difficult a Task, yet 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that a Steward should know the common Accidents of Age and Nature; such as these, that an old Man will be sooner overtaken than a Youth, one that leaps about, or talks, than he that is silent or sits still; the Thoughtful and Melancholly, than the Chearful and Brisk.</p>
                  <p>And he that understands these things is much more able to preserve Quietness and Order, than one that is perfectly ignorant and unskilful: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I think none will doubt but that the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ought to be a Friend, and have no Pique at

Others declaiming, or reading some of their own Compositions, and others proposing Prizes to Dancers and Mimicks. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> turn'd <hi>Polition</hi>'s Banquet into a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, representing there the sacred Procession and Mysteries of <hi>Ceres;</hi> now such things as these in my Opinion ought not to be suffered by a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, but he must permit such Discourse only, such Shows, such Merriment as promote the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular End and Design of such Entertainments; and that is, by pleasant Conversation, either to beget or maintain Friendship and Good-will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Guests; for an Entertainment is only an Introduction to Friendship by a Glass of Wine, and ends in Good-will.</p>
                  <p>But now because things pure and unmixt are usually surfeiting and odious, and the very Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, unless the Simples be well proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and opportunely put together; though it takes off the surfeiting Quality, yet spoils the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46331:228"/> sweetness and goodness of the Composition; 'tis evident that there ought to be a Director who might take care that the Mirth and Jollity of the Guests be exactly and opportunely temper'd. 'Tis a common saying, <hi>That a Voyage near the Land, and a Walk near the Sea, is the best Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Thus our Steward should place Seriousness and Gravity next Jollity and Humor, that when they are merry they should be on the very Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gravity it self; and when grave and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, they might be refresh'd as Sea-sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, having an easie and short Prospect to the Mirth and Jollity that is near; for Mirth may be exceeding useful, and make our grave Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses smooth and pleasant,

                     <q>With sweet Tongued Muses cur'd his Love.</q> Some said that Love was bold and daring, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing at new Contrivances, and eager to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, upon which account <hi>Plato</hi> calls it the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizer of every thing; for it makes the reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man talkative, the Modest complemental, the Negligent and Sluggish industrious and observant; and what is the greatest Wonder, a close, hard and covetous Fellow, if he happens to be in Love, as Iron in Fire becomes pliable and soft, easie, good natured, and very pleasant, as if there were something in that common Jest; a Lovers Purse is ty'd with the Blade of a Leek. Others said that Love was like Drunkenness, it makes Men warm, merry, and dilated, and when in that Condition, they naturally slide down to Songs and Words in measure; and 'tis reported of <hi>Aeschilus,</hi> that he wrote Tragedies after he was heated with a Glass of Wine; and my Grand-father <hi>Lamprias</hi> in his Cups seem'd to out-do himself in starting Questions, and smart Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:46331:229"/> and usually said, that like Frankincense he exhaled more freely after he was warm'd. And as Lovers are extreamly pleas'd with the Sight of their Beloved, so they praise with as much Satisfaction as they behold, and as Love is talkative in every thing, so more especially in Commendation; for Lovers themselves believe, and would have all others think that the Object of their Passion is pleasing and excellent; and this made <hi>Candaules</hi> the <hi>Lydian</hi> force <hi>Gyges</hi> into his Chamber to behold the Beauty of his naked Wife.

For if they present a Cock, Horse, or any other thing to the Belov'd, 'tis neatly trim'd and set off with all the Ornaments of Art, and therefore when they would present a Complement, they would have it curious and pleasing, and such as Verse usually appears; <hi>Sossius</hi> applauding these Discourses, added, perhaps we may make a probable Conjecture from <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Musick, for I have lately read the Book, and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> lays down three Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Musick, Grief, Pleasure, and Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm; for each of these Changes the usual Tone, and makes the Voice slide into a Cadence: For deep Sorrow hath something tuneable in its Groans, and therefore we perceive our Orators in their Conclusions, and Actors in their Complaints be somewhat melodious, and insensibly fall into a Tune. Excess of Joy provokes the more airy Men to frisk and dance, and keep their Steps, though unskilful in the Art; and as <hi>Pindar</hi> hath it,
<q>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:46331:230"/>They shout and roar, and wildly toss their Head;</q> But the graver sort are only excited to sing, raise their Voice, and tune their Words into a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; but Enthusiasm quite changes the Body and the Voice, and makes it far different from its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Constitution: Hence the very <hi>Bacchae</hi> use Measure, and the inspired give their Oracles in Measure: And we shall see very few Mad-men, but are frantick in Rhime, and rave in Verse. This being certain, if you will but anatomize Love a little, and look narrowly into it, 'twill appear that no Passion in the World is attended with more violent Grief, more excessive Joy, or greater Extasies and Fury; a Lovers Soul looks like <hi>Sophocles</hi> his City,
<q>
                        <l>At once 'tis full of Sacrifice,</l>
                        <l>Of joyful Songs, of Groans and Crys:</l>
                     </q> And therefore 'tis no wonder, that since Love contains all the Causes of Musick, Grief, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Enthusiasm, and is besides industrious and talkative, it should incline us more than any other Passion to Poetry and Songs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Story tells us that <hi>Mithridates</hi> the famous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Romans,</hi> amongst other Tryals of Skill that he instituted, proposed a Reward to the greatest Eater, and stoutest Drinker in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He won both the Prizes himself, he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drank every Man living, and for his Excellency that way was called <hi>Bacchus:</hi> but this Reason for his Sir-name is a vain Fancy, and an idle Story; for whilst he was an Infant, a Flash of Lightning burnt his Cradle, but did his Body no harm, only left a little Mark on his Fore-head, which his Hair covered when he was grown a Boy; and after he came to be a Man, another Flash broke into his Bed-chamber, and burnt the Arrows in a Quiver that was hanging under him; from whence his Diviners presag'd that Archers, and light arm'd Men should win him considerable Victories in his Wars, and the Vulgar gave him this Name, because in those many Dangers by Lightning, he bore some Resemblance to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46331:231"/> Bacchus:</hi> From hence great Drinkers were the Subject of our Discourse, and the Wrestler <hi>Heraclides,</hi> or, as the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> mince it, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> who lived but in the last Age, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one; he, when he could get none to hold out with him, invited some to take their Mornings-draught, others to Dinner, to Supper others, and others after, to take a merry Glass of Wine, so that as the first went off, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond came, and the third and forth Company, and he all the while, without any intermission, took his Glass round, and out-sate all the four Companies.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the Retainers to <hi>Drusus</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Son, there was a Physician that drank down all the Court, he, before he sate down, would usually take five or six bitter Almonds to prevent the Operation of the Wine, but when ever he was forbidden that, he knockt under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; and a single Glass doz'd him. Some think these Almonds have a penetrating, abster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Quality, and able to cleanse the Face, and clear it from the common Freakles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they are eaten, by their bitterness vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and fret the Pores, and by that means draw down the ascending Vapors from the Head, but in my Opinion a bitter Quality is a Dryer, and consumes Moisture: And therefore a bitter Taste is the most unpleasant, for, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being an Enemy to Moisture, unnaturally contracts the spungy and tender Nerves of the Tongue, and green Ulcers are usually drain'd by bitter Injections. Thus <hi>Homer,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>He squez'd his Herbs, and bitter Juice apply'd,</l>
                        <l>And straight the Blood was stancht, the Sore was dry'd.</l>

                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:46331:231"/> And he guesses well, that what is bitter to the Taste, is a Dryer, besides, the Powders Women use to dry up their Sweat, are bitter, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that Quality astringent. This then being certain, 'tis no wonder that the bitterness of the Almonds hinders the Operation of the Wine, since it dries the inside of the Body, and keeps the Veins from being overcharg'd: For from their Distention and Disturbance, they say Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness proceeds. And this Conjecture is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd from that which usually happens to a Fox; for if he eats bitter Almonds without drinking, his Moisture suddenly fails, and 'tis present Death.</p>

                  <p>'TWas debated why old Men lov'd the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Liquors: Some fancying that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat decay'd, and their Constitution grew cold, said such Liquors were most necessary and agreeable to their Age; but this was mean and obvious, and besides, neither a sufficient, nor a true reason; for the like happens to all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senses; for they are not easily to be mov'd, or wrought on by any Qualities, unless they are in intense Degrees, and make a vigorous Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but the reason is, the Laxity of the Habit of their Body, for that being grown lax and weak, loves a smart Stroak. Thus their Taste is pleas'd most with strong Sapors, their Smelling with brisk Odors; for strong and unallay'd Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities make a more pleasing Impression on the Sense: Their Touch is almost senseless to a Sore, and a Wound generally raises no sharp Pain:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:46331:232"/> The like also in their Hearing may be observ'd, for old Musicians play louder and sharper than others; that they might move their own dull Tympanum with the Sound: For what Steel is to the Edge of a Knife, that Spirit is to the Sense in the Body, and therefore when the Spirits fail, the Sense grows dull and stupid, and cannot be rais'd, unless by something, such as strong Wine, that makes a vigorous Impression.</p>

                     <hi>Question VIII.</hi> Why Old Men read best at a distance?</head>
                  <p>TO my Discourse in the former Problem some Objection may be drawn from the Sense of seeing in old Men; for if they hold a Book at a distance they will read pretty well, nearer they cannot see a Letter; and this <hi>Aeschyles</hi> means by these Verses,
<q>
                        <l>Far off thou canst not see, nay, scarce behold</l>
                        <l>When near; a proper Scribe now thou art old:</l>
                     </q> And <hi>Sophocles</hi> more plainly,
<q>
                        <l>Old Men are slow in Talk, they hardly hear,</l>
                        <l>For off they see, but all are blind, when near.</l>
                     </q> And therefore, if old Mens Organs are more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to strong and intense Qualities; why, when they read, do they not take the Reflection near at hand, but holding the Book a good way off, mix, and so as Wine by Water, weaken it by the intervening Air? Some answered, that they did not remove the Book to lessen the Light,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46331:232"/> but to receive more Rays, and let all the Space between the Letters and their Eyes be fill'd with lightsome Air. Others agreed with those that imagine the Rays of Vision mix with one another, for since there is a Cone stretcht between each Eye, and the Object, whose Point is in the Eye, and whose Basis is the Object, 'tis probable that for some way each Cone extends a part, and by it self; but when the distance increases, they mix, and make but one common Light, and therefore every Object appears single, and not two, though 'tis seen by both Eyes at once; for the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cones makes these two Appearances but one; these things suppos'd, the old Men that hold the Letters near to their Eyes, the Cones not being joyn'd, but each part, and by it self, their Sight is weak; but those that remove it farther, that two Lights being mingled and increast, see better, as a Man with both Hands can hold that for which either singly is too weak: But my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lamprias,</hi> though unacquainted with <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus</hi> his Notions, invented another Reason. We see, said he, by some Species that come from the Object to the Eye, which at their first rise are thick and great, and therefore when near disturb old Men, whose Eyes are not easily penetrated, and stiff; but when they are separated and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into the Air, the thick obstructing Parts are easily remov'd, and the subtle Remainders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eye, gently and easily slide into the Pores; and so the disturbance being less, the Sight is more vigorous and clear. Thus a Rose smells most fragrant at a Distance, but if you bring it near the Nose 'tis not so pure nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; and the reason is this, many earthy, disturbing Particles are carry'd with the Smell,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:46331:233"/> and spoil the Fragrancy when near, but in a longer passage those are lost, and the pure brisk Odor, by reason of its Subtlety, reaches and acts upon the Sense: But we, according to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, assert, that a bright Spirit darted from the Eye, mixes with the Light about the Object, and those two are perfectly blended into one si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Body; now these must be joyned in due proportion one to another; for one part ought not wholly to prevail on the other, but both being proportionably and amicably joyn'd, agree in one third common Power. Now this (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flux, illuminated Spirit, or Ray) in old Men being very weak, there can be no Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no Mixture with the Light about the Object, but it must be wholly consum'd, unless by removing the Letters from their Eyes, they lessen the Brightness of the Light, and so it comes to the Sight, not too strong or unmixt, but well proportioned and blended with the other. And this explains, that common Affection of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of seeing in the Dark, for their Eye-sight being weak, is overcome and darkned by the Splendor of the Day, because the little Light that flows from their Eyes cannot be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably mixt with the stronger and more numerous Beams; but is proportionable and sufficient for the Feeble Splendor of the Stars, and so can joyn with it, and cooperate to move the Sense.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THeon</hi> the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> when <hi>Metrius Florus</hi> gave us an Entertainment, askt <hi>Themistocles</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> why <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> though he frequently mention'd some strange <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature (such as pouder'd Beef soakt in salt Water grows fresher than before, Fleeces of Wooll are more easily separated by a gentle, than a quick and violent Force, and Men that are fasting, eat slower than those that took a Breakfast) yet never gave any reason for the appearance: And <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> replied, that <hi>Chrysippus</hi> only propos'd such things by the by, as Instances to correct us, who easily assent, and without any reason, to what seems likely, and disbelieve every thing which seems unlikely at the first sight. But why, Sir, are you concern'd at this? For if you are speculative, and would enquire into the Causes of things, you need not want Subjects in your own Profession; but pray tell me why <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Nausicae</hi> wash in the River rather than the Sea, though it was near, and in all likelihood hotter, clearer, and fitter to wash with than that. And <hi>Theon</hi> reply'd, <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath already given an account for this, from the grossness of the Sea-water; for in this, abundance of rough, earthy Particles are mixt, and those make it salt; and upon this account Swimmers, or any other Weight, sink not so much in Sea-water as in fresh, for the latter being thin and weak, yields to every Pressure, and is easily divided, because 'tis pure and unmixt, and by reason of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46331:234"/> of Parts it penetrates better than Salt-water, and so loosneth from the Cloaths the sticking particles of the Spot: And is not this Discourse of <hi>Aristotle</hi> very probable? Probable indeed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, but not true, for I have observed that with Ashes, Gravel, or if those are not to be gotten, with Dust it self, they usually thicken the Water, as if the earthy Particles being rough, would scour better than fair Water, whose thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes it weak and ineffectual; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is mistaken, when he says the thickness of the Sea-water hinders the Effect, since the sharpness of the mixt Particles very much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make it cleansing; for that opens the Pores, and draws out the Stain. But since all oily Matter is most difficult to be washt out, and spots a Cloath, and the Sea is oily, that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it doth not scour as well as fresh; and that 'tis oily even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself asserts; for Salt in his Opinion hath some Oyl in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes Candles, when sprinkled on them, burn the better, and clearer than before: And Sea-water sprinkled on a Flame encreaseth it, and is more easily kindled than any other, and this in my Opinion makes it hotter than the fresh; and besides, I may urge another Cause, for the end of Washing is Drying, and that seems cleanest which is dryest, and the Moisture that scours, (as Hellebore, with the Humors that it purges) ought to fly away quickly together with the Stain: The Sun quickly draws out the fresh Water because it is so light, but Salt-water being rough, lodges in the Pores, and therefore is not easily dry'd: And <hi>Theon</hi> reply'd, you say just nothing, Sir, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> in the same Book affirms, that those that wash in the Sea, if they stand in the Sun, are
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:46331:234"/> sooner dry'd than those that wash in the fresh Streams. 'Tis true, I answered, he says so, but I hope that <hi>Homer</hi> asserting the contrary, will by you especially be more easily believ'd, for <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> as he writes, after his Shipwrack meeting <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicae,</hi>
                     <q>A frightful Sight, and with the Salt besmear'd,</q> said to her Maidens,
<q>Retire a while till I have wash'd my Skin;</q> And when he had leapt into the River,
<q>He from his Head did scour the foaming Sea.</q> The Poet knew very well what happens in such a Case; for when those that come wet out of the Sea stand in the Sun, the subtlest and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est parts suddenly exhale, but the salt and rough Particles stick upon the Body in a Crust, till they are washt away by the fresh Water of a Spring.</p>

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46331:235"/> It had been a very notable Tryal of Skill: The King <hi>Philopappus</hi> being very generous and magnificent in his Rewards, and defraying the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of all the Tribes: He was at the same Feast with us, and being a very good humor'd Man, and eager for Instruction, he would now and then freely discourse of antient Customs, and as freely hear: <hi>Marcus</hi> the Grammarian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus; <hi>Neanthes</hi> the <hi>Cyzicenian,</hi> in his Book called <hi>the Fabulous Narrations of this City,</hi> affirms that it was a Priviledge of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Tribe, that their Dance should never be determined to be last: 'Tis true, he brings some Stories for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what he says; but if he falsifies, the Matter is open, and let us all inquire after the reason of the thing: But says <hi>Milo,</hi> suppose it be a meer Tale. 'Tis no strange thing, reply'd <hi>Philopappus,</hi> if in our Disquisitions after truth, we meet now and then with such a thing as <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the Philosopher did; for he one day eating a Cucumber, and finding it of a Honey Taste, askt his Maid where she bought it; and she tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in such a Garden, he rose from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bad her direct him to the Place: the Maid surpriz'd, askt him what he meat; and he reply'd, I must search after the Cause of the Sweetness of the Fruit; and shall find it the sooner if I see the place; and the Maid with a smile reply'd sit still, pray Sir, for I unwittingly put it into a Honey Barrel: And he, as it were discontented, cry'd out, <hi>Shame take thee, yet I'le pursue my purpose, and seek after the Cause, as if this Sweetness were a Taste natural, and proper to the Fruit.</hi> Therefore neither will we admit <hi>Xeanthes</hi> his Credulity and Inadvertency in some Stories as an Excuse, and a good reason for avoiding this

Now each Book being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ten Questions, that shall make the first in this, which Socratical <hi>Xenophon</hi> hath as it were propos'd; for he tells us, that <hi>Gobias</hi> banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Cyrus</hi> amongst other things which he found admirable in the <hi>Persians,</hi> was surpriz'd to hear them ask one another such Qustions, which to be interrogated was more delightful than to be let alone, and pass such jests on one another, that 'twas more pleasant to be jested on, than not; for if some even whilst they praise, offend; why should not their polite and neat facetiousness be admir'd, whose very raillery is delightful and pleasant to him that is the Subject of it: Here <hi>Sopatrus</hi> our Entertainer said, I wish I could learn what kind of Questions those are, for to be skill'd in, and make right use of, Apposite Questions, and pleasant raillery, I think is no small part of Conversation: A considerable one, I reply'd, but pray observe whether <hi>Xenophon</hi> himself, in his descriptions of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s, and the <hi>Persian,</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, hath not sufficiently explain'd them; but if you would have my thoughts first, Men are pleas'd to be ask'd those Questions to which
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46331:237"/> they have an answer ready; such are those in which the persons ask'd have some skill, and competent knowledge; for when the Enquiry is above their reach, those that can return nothing are troubled, as if requested to give something beyond their power; and those that do answer, producing some crude and insufficient demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, must needs be very much concern'd, and apt to blunder on the wrong: Now if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer be not only easy, but hath something not common, it is more pleasing to him that makes it; and this happens, when their knowledge is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Vulgars, as suppose they are well skill'd in points of Astrology or Logick: For not only in action, and serious matters, but also in Discourse every one hath a natural disposition to be pleas'd (as <hi>Euripides</hi> hath it)
<q>To seem far to out-do himself;</q> And all are delighted when Men put such Questions as they understand, and would have others know that they are acquainted with, and therefore Travellers and Merchants are most satisfy'd, when their company is inquisitive about other Countrys, the unknown Ocean, and the Laws and Manners of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> they are very ready to inform them, and describe the Countrys and the Greeks, imagining this to be some recompense for their toyl, some comfort for all the dangers they have past: In short, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though unrequested, we are wont to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of, we are desirous to be ask'd, because then we seem to gratify those, whom otherwise our prattle would disturb and force from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:46331:238"/> And this is the common disease of Travellers: The more gentiel and the modest Men love to be ask'd about those things which they have bravely and successfully perform'd, and which modesty will not permit to be spoken by themselves before Company; and therefore <hi>Nestor</hi> did well, when being acquainted with <hi>Ʋllysses</hi> his desire of Reputation, he said,
<q>
                        <l>Tell brave <hi>Ulysses,</hi> Glory of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>How you the Horses seiz'd;</l>
                     </q> For Men cannot endure the insolence of those who praise themselves, and repeat their own Exploits, unless the Company desires it, and they are forc'd to a Relation; therefore it tickles them to be askt about their Embassays, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations of the Common-wealth, if they have done any thing notable in either; and upon this account the Envious and ill-natur'd start very few Qustions of that sort; they thwart and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all such kind of Motions, being very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give any occasion or opportunity for that Discourse which shall tend to the advantage of the Relator. In short, we please those to whom we put them, when we start Questions about those matters which their Enemies hate to hear: <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> says to <hi>Alcinous,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>You bid me tell what various Ills I bore,</l>
                        <l>That the sad tale might make me grieve the more.</l>
                     </q> And <hi>Oedipus</hi> says to the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
                     <q>'Tis pain to raise again a buried grief:</q> But <hi>Euripides</hi> on the contrary,

                        <l>How sweet it is, when we are lul'd in ease</l>

                     </q> True indeed, but not to those that are still tost, still under a Misfortune: Therefore, be sure never ask any Man about his own Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitys; 'tis irksom to relate his losses of Children or Estate, or any unprosperous adventure by Sea or Land; but to ask a Man how he carry'd the Cause, how he was carress'd by the King; how escaped such a Storm, such an Assault; Thieves and the like; this pleaseth him, he seems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it over again in his relation, and is never weary of the <hi>Topick.</hi> Besides, Men love to be ask'd about their happy Friends, or Children that have made good progress in Philosophy, the Law, or are great at Court; as also about the disgrace, and open conviction of their Enemys; for of such matters they are most eager to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; yet are cautious of beginning it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, lest they should seem to insult over, and rejoyce at the misery of others: You please a Hunter if you ask him about Dogs, a Wrestler about Exercise; and an Amorous Man about Beautys; the Ceremonious and Superstitious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses about Dreams, and what success he hath had by following the directions of Omens, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the kindness of the Gods; and some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions concerning those things will extreamly please him: He that inquires any thing of an old Man, though the story doth not all concern him, wins his heart, and urges one that is very willing to discourse;
<q>
                        <l>

                     </q> Here is a Multitude of Questions and variety of Subjects; which is much better than to confine and cramp his Answers, and so deprive the Old Men of the most pleasant enjoyment they can have. In short, They that had rather please than distast, will still propose such Qustions, the Answers to which shall rather get the praise and good-will, than contempt and hatred of the Hearers. And so much of Questions.</p>
                  <p>As for Raillery, those that cannot use it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously, with art, and time it well, should never venture at it: For as in a slippery place, if you but just touch a Man as you pass by, you throw him down; so when we are in drink, we are in danger of tripping at every little word that is not spoken with due address: And we are more apt to be offended with a joque, than a plain and scurrilous abuse; for we see the latter often slip from a Man unwittingly in Passion, but consider the former as a thing voluntary, proceeding from malice and ill-nature, and therefore we are generally more offended at a sharp jeerer, than a whifling snarler: 'Tis evident, that every joque bites, but an abuse is affronting, and purposely design'd; for instance, he that calls the Costard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, plainly and openly abuseth; but he that says, I remember when you wip't your Nose upon your Sleeve, smartly jeers: Such was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s to <hi>Octavius</hi> who was thought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from an <hi>African,</hi> for when <hi>Cicero</hi> spoke something, and <hi>Octavius</hi> said he did not hear him, <hi>Cicero</hi> rejoyn'd, True, for you have a hole through your Ear: And <hi>Melanthus</hi> when he was ridicul'd
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:46331:239"/> by a <hi>Commedian,</hi> said, You pay me now some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that you do not owe me; and upon this account jeers vex more; for like Bearded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows they stick a long while, and gall the wounded sufferer: Their smartness is pleasant, and delights the Company, and those that are pleas'd with the saying seem to believe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting speaker: For according to <hi>Theophrastus</hi> a jeer is a Figurative reproach for some fault or misdeameanor, and therefore he that hears it supplys the conceal'd part, as if he had some knowledge in, and gave credit to the thing; for he that laughs and is tickled at what <hi>Theocritus</hi> said to one whom he suspected of a Design upon his Cloaths, asking him if he went to Supper at such a Place: Yes, he reply'd, I go, but shall likewise lodge there all Night, doth as it were confirm the accusation, and believe the fellow was a Thief; and therefore an impertinent jeerer makes the whole Company seem ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd and abusive, as being pleas'd with, and consenting to, the scurrility of the jeer: 'Twas one of the excellent Laws of <hi>Sparta, That none should be bitter in their jests, and the jeer'd patiently endure; but if he took offence, the other was to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and pursue the frolick no farther:</hi> How is it possible therefore to determine such raillery as shall delight and please the Person that is jested on, when to be smart without offence, is no mean piece of cunning and address? First, then, such as will vex and gall the Conscious, must please those that are clean, innocent, and not suspected of the matter; such a joque is <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>'s, when he pleasantly brings in a very ugly ill-lookt fellow, and is smart upon him for being <hi>Sambaulas minion:</hi> Such was that of <hi>Aufidius Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destus,</hi>
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:46331:240"/> who when our Friend <hi>Quintus</hi> in an Ague complaln'd his hands were cold, reply'd, Sir, you brought them warm from your Province; for this made <hi>Quintus</hi> laugh, and extreamly pleas'd him; yet it had been a reproach and abuse to a covetous and oppressing Governour: Thus <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> pretending to compare Faces with the beauteous <hi>Critobulus,</hi> rally'd only, and not abus'd: And <hi>Alcibiades</hi> again was smart on <hi>Socrates,</hi> as his Rival in <hi>Agathos</hi>'s affection: Kings are pleas'd when jests are put upon them as if they were private, and poor men; such were the Flatterers to <hi>Philip</hi> when he chid him, <hi>Sir, don't I keep you?</hi> For those that mention faults of which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not really guilty, intimate those Virtues, with which they are really adorn'd: But then 'tis requisite that those Virtues should be evident, and certainly belong to them, otherwise the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course will breed disturbance and suspition: He that tells a very rich Man that he will procure him a Sum of Money; a temperate sober Man, and one that drinks Water only, that he is foxt, or hath taken a Cup too much; a hospitable, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, good humour'd Man, that he is a niggard and pinch-penny; or threatens an Excellent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer to meet him at the Bar; must make the persons smile, and please the Company: Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> was very obliging and complaisant when he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd his Play-fellows at those sports, in which he was sure to be overcome; and <hi>Ismenias</hi> piping at a Sacrifice, when no good Omens appear'd, the Man that hir'd him snatcht the Pipe, and play'd very ridiculously himself; and when all found fault, he said, <hi>To play satisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the gift of Heaven:</hi> And <hi>Ismenias</hi> with a smile reply'd, <hi>Whilst I play'd the Gods were so well pleased
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:46331:240"/> that they are careless of the Sacrifice, but to be rid of thy noise, they presently receiv'd it.</hi>

                  <p>But more, those that jocosely put scandalous names upon things commendable, if opportunely done, please more then he that plainly and openly commends; for those that cover a reproach under fair and respectful words (as he that calls an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Man <hi>Aristides,</hi> a Coward <hi>Achilles</hi>) gall more than those that openly abuse: Such is that of <hi>Oedipus</hi> in <hi>Sophocles,</hi>

Thus <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the <hi>Mytilenian</hi> was pleasant enough, when knocking at a Mans Door that was much given to singing, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Harp, and being bid come in, said, I will if you will tye up your Harp; but <hi>Lysias</hi> his flatterer was offensive, for being frighted at a Wooden Scorpion that he threw into his lap, and leaping out of his seat, after he knew the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, said; <hi>And I'le fright your Majesty too; give me a Talent.</hi>

                  <p>In several things about the Body too the like caution is to be observ'd; thus he that is jested on for a flat or hookt nose usually laughs at the jest: (Thus <hi>Cassanders</hi> friend was not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd when <hi>Theophrastus</hi> said to him, <hi>'Tis strange, Sir, that your Eyes don't play, since your Nose is so near, and so well fitted for a Pipe:</hi> And <hi>Cyrus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a long hawk nos'd fellow to marry a flat nos'd Girl, for then they would very well agree:) A jest on any for his stinking breath, or filthy

                  <p>Love, as in most things else, so in this matter causes different effects; for some Lovers are pleas'd, some displeas'd at a merry jest; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:46331:242"/> in this case a fit time time must be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately observ'd; for as a blast of Wind puffs out a Fire whilst 'tis weak and little, but when throughly kindled strengthens and increaseth it; so Love, before 'tis evident and confess'd, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd at a discoverer, but when it breaks forth, and blazes in every bodies Eyes, then 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with, and gathers strength by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent blasts of joque and raillery: When their beloved are present 'twill gratify them most to pass a jest upon their passion, but to fall on any other Subject will be counted an abuse: If they are remarkably loving to their own Wives, or entertain a generous affection for a hopeful youth, then are they proud, then tickled when jeer'd for such a Love: And therefore <hi>Archesilaus</hi> when an Amorous Man in his School laid down this Proposition, <hi>In my opinion one thing cannot touch another,</hi> reply'd, <hi>Sir, you touch this Person,</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a lovely Boy that sate near him: Beside, the Company must be considered; for what a Man will only laugh at when mentioned amongst his friends and familiar acquaintance, he will not endure to be told of before his Wife, Father, or his Tutor; unless perhaps it be something that will please those too; as for instance, if before a Philosopher, one should jeer a Man for going barefoot, or studying all night; or before his Father for carefulness and thrift; or in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Wife, for his being cold to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and doting upon her: Thus <hi>Tygranes,</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> askt him, <hi>What will your Wife say when she hears that you are put to servile Offices?</hi> reply'd, <hi>Sir, she will not hear it, but be present her self, and see it:</hi> Again, those joques are accounted less affronting, which reflect somewhat also on the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:46331:242"/> Man that makes them; as when one poor Man base born Fellow, or a Lover joques upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for whatever comes from one in the same circumstances looks more like a piece of Mirth, than a design'd Affront; but otherwise it must needs be irksom, and distastful: Upon this account, when a Slave, whom the King had lately freed and enricht, behav'd himself very impertinently in the company of some Philosophers; asking them, <hi>How it came to pass that the Broth of Beans, whether white or black was always green; Aridices</hi> putting another Question, <hi>Why, let the whips be white or not, the wales and marks they made were still red;</hi> displeas'd him extreamly, and made him rise from the Table in a great rage and discontent. But <hi>Amphias</hi> the <hi>Tarsian,</hi> who was suppos'd to be sprung from a Gardner, joquing upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Friend, for his obscure and mean birth, and presently subjoyning; But 'tis true, I sprung from the same Seed, caused much mirth and laughter: And the Harper very facetiously put a check to <hi>Philips</hi> ignorance, and impertinence; for when <hi>Philip</hi> pretended to correct him, he cryed out, <hi>God forbid, Sir, that ever you should be brought so low as to understand these things better than I;</hi> for by this seeming joque he instructed him without giving any offence; and therefore some of the <hi>Comedians</hi> seem to lay aside their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness in every jest that may reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; as <hi>Aristophanes</hi> when he is merry upon a Bald-pate; and <hi>Cratinus</hi> in his Play, <hi>Pytane</hi> upon Drunkenness and Excess: Besides, you must be very careful that the jest should seem to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore,</hi> taken from some present Question or merry Humour, not far fetcht, as if premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and designed: For as Men are not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

                  <p>IN <hi>Eleusine,</hi> after the solemn celebration of the Sacred Mysteries, <hi>Glaucias</hi> the Orator enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us at a Feast; where after the rest had done, <hi>Xenocles</hi> his Brother, as his humour is, began to be smart upon my Brother <hi>Lamprias</hi> for his
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46331:243"/> good <hi>Beotian</hi> Stomach; and I, in his defence, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Xenocles,</hi> who was an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> said, <hi>Pray, Sir, do not all place the very height of pleasure in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of pain and indolence?</hi> But <hi>Lamprias,</hi> who prefers the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> before the Garden, ought by his practice to confirm <hi>Aristotles</hi> Doctrine; for he affirms that every Man hath a better Stomach in the Autumn, than in other Seasons of the Year; and gives the reason which I cannot remember at present: So much the better (says <hi>Glaucias</hi>) for when Supper's done, we will endeavour to discover it our selves: that being over, <hi>Glaucias</hi> and <hi>Xenocles</hi> drew various reasons from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Fruit; one said, that it scoured the body, and by his Evacuation continually rais'd new Appetites, <hi>Xenocles</hi> affirm'd, that ripe fruit had usually a pleasing, vellicating sapor, and thereby provokt the Appetite better than Sauces, or Sweet-meats; for Sick-men of a vitiated Stomach usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recover it by eating Fruit: But <hi>Lamprias</hi> said, that our natural heat, the principal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nutrition, in the midst of Summer is scatter'd, and becomes rare and weak, but as that declines, unites again and gathers strength, being shut in by the ambient cold, and contraction of the Pores; and I, for my part, said, in Summer we are more thirsty, and use more moisture than in other Seasons, and therefore Nature (she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the same method in all her operations) at this change of Seasons employs the contrary, makes us hungry, and to maintain an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Body, gives us dry Food to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the moisture taken in the Summer; yet none can deny but that the Food it self is a partial cause, for not only new Fruit, Bread, Corn, but Flesh of the same Year is better tasted than those

                  <p>WHen upon a Dream I had forborn Eggs a long time on purpose that in an Egg, as some do in a Heart, I might make experiment of a notable Vision that often troubled me, some at <hi>Sossius Senecio</hi>'s Table sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I was tainted with <hi>Orpheus</hi> or <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> his Opinions, and refus'd to eat an Egg (as some do the Heart and Brain) imagining it to be the principle of Generation; and <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Epicurean</hi> ridiculingly repeated,

                     </gap>, and thought it as unlawful to feed on Eggs as on the Animals that lay them: Now to pretend a Dream, for the cause of my abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> had been a defence more irrational than the cause it self; and therefore I suffered jocose <hi>Alexander</hi> to enjoy his Opinion, for he was a pleasant Man, and of excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Soon after he propos'd that perplext Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that Plague of the inquisitive, <hi>Which was first, the Bird or the Egg?</hi> And my Friend <hi>Sylla</hi> saying, that with this little Question, as with an Engin, we shook the great and weighty truth (the Opinion that the world had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) declared his dislike of such Problems;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46331:244"/> but <hi>Alexander</hi> deriding the Question, as slight and impertinent, my Son-in-law <hi>Phirmus</hi> said, Well, Sir, at present your Atoms will do me some service; for if we must suppose that small things must be the principles of greater; 'tis likely that the Egg was before the Bird; for that amongst sensible things is very simple, and the Bird more mixt, and contains a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of parts: 'Tis universally true, that a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is before that whose principle it is; now the Seed is a principle, and the Egg is somewhat more than the Seed, and less than the Bird; for as a disposition, a progress in goodness, is something between a tractable Mind, and a habit of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; so an Egg is as it were a progress of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tending from the Seed to a perfect Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l▪ And as in an Animal they say the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are form'd first, upon the same account the Egg should be before the Bird, as the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining before the thing contain'd: Thus Art first makes rude and ill shapen Figures, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perfects every thing with its proper form; and 'twas for this method that the Statuary <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletis</hi> said, <hi>Then our work is most difficult when the Clay is to be fashioned into a Nail;</hi> so 'tis probable that the matter not readily obeying the slow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of contriving Nature, at first frames rude and indefinite Masses, as the Egg, and of these moulded anew, and joyn'd in better order, the Animal afterward is form'd: As the Canker is first, and then growing dry and cleaving lets forth a winged Animal, called <hi>Psyche;</hi> so the Egg is first as it were the subject matter of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for 'tis certain that in every change, that out of which the thing changes, must be before the thing changing: Observe how
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:46331:245"/> Worms and Catterpillers are bred in Trees from the moisture corrupted or concocted; now none can say but that the ingendring moisture is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before all these; for (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) Matter is as a Mother or Nurse in respect of the Bodies that are form'd, and that we call the matter, out of which any thing that is, is made: And with a smile, continued he, I speak to those that are acquainted with the Mystical and Sacred Discourse of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> who not only affirms the Egg to be before the Bird, but makes it the first Being in the whole World: The other parts, because deep mysteries we shall now pass by, but let us look upon the various kinds of Animals, and we shall find almost every one beginning from an Egg, Fowls and Fishes, Land Animals, as Lizards; Amphibious as Crocodiles; some with two Legs, as a Cock; some without any, as a Snake; and some with many, as a Locust. And therefore in the solemn Feast of <hi>Bacchus</hi> 'tis very well done to dedicate an Egg, as the Emblem of that which begets, and contains every thing in it self.</p>
                  <p>To this Discourse of <hi>Hermus, Senecio</hi> reply'd, Sir, your last Similitude contradicts your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46331:248"/> they come up close, and lay hold of one another to trip and overturn him; and in this, they say, Our Country-men being better Westlers, very much distress'd the <hi>Spartans</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctra;</hi> and <hi>Aeschilus</hi> describes a Warrier thus,

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:46331:249"/> Soil to it, and a Soil should have a breeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and therefore we choose the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stocks to Graft on, as Women that are full of Milk when we would put out a Child to nurse; but every body knows that the Firr, Cypress and the like, are no great bearers; for as Men very Fat have few Children (for the whole nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being imploy'd in the body, there remains no overplus to make Seed) so these Trees spending all their Sap in their own Stock, flourish indeed, and grow great, but as for Fruit, some bear none at all, some very little, and that too slowly ripens; therefore 'tis no wonder that they will not nourish anothers Fruit, which are so very sparing to their own.</p>

Then said I, This is a meer shift, and avoiding of the Question, rather than a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cause, but if we please to consider, we shall find a great many accidents that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Consequents of the effect to be unjustly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd the causes of it; as for instance, if we should fancy, that by the blossoming of the Chast-tree, the fruit of the Vine is ripened; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is a common saying,
<q>The Chast-tree blossoms, and the Grapes grow ripe;</q> or that the little protuberances in the Candle-snuff thicken the Air, and make it cloudy; or the hookt ness of the Nails to be the cause, and not an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident consequential to an Ulcer in the Lungs; therefore as those things mention'd are but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents to the Effect, through proceeding from one and the same cause, so one and the same cause stops the Ship, and joyns the <hi>Echeneis</hi> to it; for the Ship continuing dry, nor yet made heavy by the moisture soaking into the Wood, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it lightly glides o're, and as long as 'tis clean easily cuts the Waves; but when 'tis throughly soakt, when weeds, ouze, and filth sticks upon its sides, the stroke of the Ship is more obtuse and weak, and the Water coming upon this clammy Matter, doth not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part from it; and this is the reason why they usually calk their Ships: Now 'tis likely that the <hi>Echeneis</hi> in this case sticking upon the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:46331:250"/> clammy Matter, is not thought an accidental consequent to this cause, but the very cause it self.</p>

                  <p>AFter the former Discourse, mention was made of those Sheep that Wolves have bitten, for 'tis commonly said of them, that their Flesh is very sweet, and their Wool breeds Worms: My Son-in-law <hi>Patroclias</hi> seem'd to be pretty happy in his reasoning upon the first part; saying, That the beast by biting it did mollify the Flesh; for Wolves Spirits are so hot and fiery, that they soften and digest the hardest Bones; and for the same reason things bitten by Wolves rot sooner than others: but concerning the Wooll we could not agree being not fully resolv'd, whether it breeds those Worms, or only opens a passage for them, separating the Flesh by it's fretting rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or proper warmth; and that this power proceeded from the Spirits of the biting Wolf, which alter even the very Hair of the Creature that it kills: And this some particular instances seem to confirm, for we know some Huntsmen and Cooks will kill a Beast with one stroak, so that it never breaths after, whilst others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat their blows and scarce do it with a great deal of trouble: But what is more strange, some as they kill it infuse such a quality that the Flesh rots presently, and cannot be kept sweet above a day; yet others that dispatch it as soon find no such alteration, but the Flesh will keep sweet a long while: And that by the manner of killing, a great alteration is made even in the Skins, Nails,

               <p>It was a remarkable instance of the prudence of <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> who going into the Regions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Souls, would not exchange so much as one word with his Mother there, till he had first obtain'd an answer from the Oracle, and dispatch'd the business he came about; and then turning to her, he afforded some small time for a few imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent questions about the other Women upon the place; asking which was <hi>Tyro,</hi> and which the fair <hi>Chloris,</hi> and concerning the unfortunate <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casta,</hi>

                     <l>Noos'd to a lofty Beam, she would suspended dye?</l>
                  </q> But we through extream sloth and ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stupidly careless of our own Affairs, must be idly spending our time and talk, either about our Neighbours Pedigree, how that such a one had a Tapster for his Grand-father, and that his Grand mother was a Laundress; or that another owes three or four hundred pounds, and is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay the interest; nay, and such trivial stuff as we busy our selves about, where such a Mans Wife has been all this while; and what 'twas, that this and the other fellow have been talking of in a Corner. But the wise <hi>Socrates</hi> employ'd his Curiosity to better purpose, when he went about, inquiring by what excellent precepts <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> obtain'd so great Authority among his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and <hi>Aristippus</hi> meeting <hi>Ischomachus</hi> at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, ask'd him what those notions
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:46331:256"/> were, with which <hi>Socrates</hi> had so powerfully charm'd the minds of his young Scholars; upon the slight information whereof, he was so passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately inflam'd with a desire of going to <hi>Athens,</hi> that he grew pale and lean, and almost languish'd till he came to drink at the Fountain it self, and had been acquainted with the Person of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and more fully learn'd that Philosophy of his, the design of which was to teach Men how to discover their own ills, and apply proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies unto them. But to some sort of Men, their own life and actions would appear the most unpleasing spectacle in the world, therefore they fly from the light of their Conscience, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the torture of one reflecting thought upon themselves; for when the Soul being once defil'd with all manner of wickedness, is scar'd at its own hideous deformity; it endeavours to run from it self, and ranging here and there, pampers its own malignity with malicious speculations on the ills of others.</p>
               <p>It is observ'd of the Hen, that loathing the plenty of Meat that is cast before her on a clean floor, she will be scratching in a hole, or spurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dung-hill, in search of one single musty grain: So this over-busy people neglecting such obvious and common things, into which any Man may inquire, and talk of without offence, cannot be satisfy'd, unless they rake into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and conceal'd evils of every Family in the Neighbourhood. It was smartly said of the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> who being ask'd, what 'twas he carried so close? Reply'd; <hi>It was therefore cover'd, that it might be secret:</hi> Which answer will serve to check the Curiosity of those impertinent Men, who will be always peeping into the privacies of others; for
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:46331:257"/> assuredly, <hi>there's nothing usually more conceal'd, then what is too foul to be seen, nor would it be kept so close, were it either fit or safe it should be known.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knocking at the door, 'tis great rudeness to enter into anothers house, and therefore in former times were▪ Rappers fitted to the Gates, that by the noise thereof, notice might be given to the Family; for the same purpose are Porters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed now, lest a stranger coming in unawares, the Mistress, or Daughter of the Family might be surpriz'd busy, or undress'd, or a Servant be seen under Correction, or the Maids be over-heard in the heat of their Scolding: but a Person of this prying, busy temper, who would disdain the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited to a sober and well-govern'd House, will yet even forcibly intrude himself as a spy into the indecencies of private Families, and those very things which Locks, Bolts, and Doors were intended to secure from common view, he prys into, for no other end, but to discover to all the World. <hi>Aristo</hi> said, that those winds were the most troublesom, which blew up ones Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and expos'd ones nakedness; but these inquisitive People deprive us of all the shalter or security of Walls and Doors, and like the wanton air which pervades th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So as 'tis merrily said by the <hi>Comedian</hi> concerning <hi>Cleon,</hi> that his Body was in one Country, and his Soul in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Hands and Feet, Eyes and Thoughts of Inquisitive Persons are stragling about in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at once: neither the Mansions of the Great; not the Cottages of the Poor; nor the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:46331:257"/> privy Chambers of Princes; nor the recesses of the nuptial Alcove, can escape the search of their Curiosity; they are familiar to the affairs of Strangers, and will be prying into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mysteries of State, although it be to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest peril of their being ruin'd by it. For as to him that will be curiously examining the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Medicinal Herbs, the unwary taste of a venemous plant, conveys a deleterious impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the Brain, before its noxious quality can be discern'd by the Palate: So they that boldly pry into the ills of great Persons, usually meet with their own destruction, sooner then they can discover the dangerous secret they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after. And so it happens, that when the rashly curious Eye, not contented to expatiate in the free and boundless region of reflected light, will be gazing at the imperial seat of brightness: it becomes a Sacrifice to the burning Rays, and streight sinks down in penal darkness.</p>
               <p>It was therefore well said by <hi>Philippides</hi> the Comedian, who being ask'd by King <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> what he desir'd might be imparted to him; reply'd, <hi>Any thing but a secret.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed those things in the Courts of Princes, that are most pleasant in themselves, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to be known; such as Balls, Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Entertainments, and all the shews of Pomp, and Greatness, are expos'd to common view, nor do they ever hide those divertisements, and injoyments, which are the attendants of a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous estate: but in what cases soever they seem reserv'd, as when they are conceiving some high displeasure, or contriving the methods of a revenge, or raging under a fit of jealousie, or suspicious of the disloyal practices of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46331:258"/> or dubious concerning the treachery of a Favourite; come not near, nor intermeddle, for every thing is of a dreadful aspect, and of very dangerous access, that is thus conceal'd. Fly from so black a Cloud, whose darkness condenses into a Tempest; and it will be time enough, when its fury breaks forth with Flash and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for thee to observe upon whose head the mischief falls.</p>
               <p>But to avoid the danger of this Curiosity, divert thy thoughts to more safe and delightful enquiries; survey the wonders of nature in the Heavens, Earth, the Sea, and Air; in which thou hast a copious choice of materials for the more sublime, as well as the more easy and obvious contemplations. If thy more pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing wit aspires to the noblest enquiries, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greater Luminary in it's diurnal motion, in what part of Heaven its Morning beams are kindled, and where those Chambers of the Night are plac'd, which entertain its declining lusture. View the Moon in all her Changes, the just representation of human vicissitudes; and learn the causes that destroy, and then restore her brightness.</p>

               </q>
               <p>These are indeeed the great secrets of nature, whose depth may perhaps amaze and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thy enquiries; search therefore into things more obvious, why the fruits of Plants are shap'd into such variety of Figures? Why some
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:46331:258"/> are cloath'd with the verdure of a perennial spring, and others which sometime were no less fresh and fair, like hasty spend-thrifts, lavish away the bounties of Heaven in one Summers Gayety, and stand naked to the succeeding Frosts. But such harmless speculations will perchance affect thee little, and it may be thou hast that malignity in thy temper, which like venemous Beasts that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live out of stink, and putrefaction, must be ever preying upon the follies and miseries of Mankind. Peruse therefore the Histories of the world, wherein thou shalt find such vast heaps of Wickedness and Mischief, made up of the downfals, and sudden deaths of great Men, the Rapes, and defilements of Women, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of Servants, the falseness of Friends, the arts of Poysoning, the fatal effects of Envy and Jealousy, the ruin of Families, dethroning of Princes, with many other such direful occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as may not only delight and satisfy, but even cloy and nauseate thy ill-natur'd curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
               <p>But neither (as it appears) are such antiquated evils any agreeable entertainment to People of this perverse disposition; they hearken most to modern Tragedies, and such doleful accidents as may be grateful as well for the novelty, as the horrour of the relation. All pleasant and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful converse is irksome to 'em; so that if they happen into a company that are talking of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, the Solemnities of Sacred Rites, or Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Processions; they make as though they heard not, or to divert, and shorten the discourse, will pretend they knew as much before; yet if any one should relate how such a Wench had a Child before the time, or that a Fellow was caught with
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:46331:259"/> another Mans Wife, or that certain People were at Law with each other, or that there was an unhappy difference between near Relations; he no longer sits unconcern'd, or minds other things, but
<q>
                     <l>With ears prick'd up, he listens; <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And <hi>how</hi> he asks; pray say, let's hear't again.</l>
                  </q> And indeed that proverbial saying, <hi>Ill news goes quick and far,</hi> was occasion'd chiefly by these busy ill-natur'd Men, who very unwillingly hear, or talk of any thing else. For their Ears, like cupping glasses that attract the most noxious humors in the Body, are ever sucking in the most spiteful, and malicious reports; and as in some Cities there are certain Ominous Gates, through which, nothing passes but Scavingers Carts, or the sleads of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: So nothing goes in at their Ears, or out of their Mouths, but obscene, Tragical, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Relations.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This noise is to them like the <hi>Syren</hi>'s Song, and the sweetest melody, the most pleasant hearing in the World.</p>
               <p>Now this Curiosity being an affectation of knowledge in things conceal'd, must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a great degree of <hi>Spight,</hi> and <hi>Envy;</hi> for Men do not usually hide, but ambitiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim whatever is for their honour or interest to be known; and therefore to pry into what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously cover'd, can be for no other purpose;
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:46331:259"/> then that secret delight curious persons injoy in the discovery of other Mens ill, which is <hi>Spight;</hi> and the relief they gather thence, to ease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under their tormenting resentments at anothers Prosperity, which is <hi>Envy;</hi> both which spring from that Savage, and Brutal disposition, which we call <hi>Ill-nature.</hi> But how ungrateful it is to mankind to have their Evils inquir'd into, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence; that some have chosen rather to dye, then disclose a secret Disease to their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician. Suppose then that <hi>Needham</hi> or <hi>Lower,</hi> or the immortal <hi>Willis,</hi> when he was upon Earth, should have gone about from house to house, inquiring whether any there had a <hi>Fistula in Ano,</hi> or a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in Ʋtero</hi> to be cur'd: Although such a Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity as this might in them seem much more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the Charity of their Design, and the benefit intended by their Art; yet who would not rebuke the sawcy officiousness of that Quack, who should unsent for, thus impudently pry into those privy Distempers, which the modesty, or perhaps the guilt of the Patient could blush, or abhor to discover, though it were for the sake of a Cure. But those that are of this curious and busy humour, cannot forbear searching into these, and other ills too that are of a more secret nature; and which makes the practice the more exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly odious and detestable, the intent is not to remedy, but expose them to the World. It is not ill-taken, if the Searchers, and Offiers of the Customs do inspect Goods openly imported; but only, when with a design of being vexatious and troublesom, they rip up the unsuspected Packets of private Passengers; and yet even this they are by Law authorized to do, and it is sometimes to their loss if they do it not: but curious and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesom
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:46331:260"/> People will be ever inquiring into other Mens Affairs, without leave or Commission, though it be to the great neglect and damage of their own.</p>
               <p>It is farther observable concerning this sort of Men, how averse they are to living long in the Country, as being not able to endure the quiet, and calm of a retired solitude: But if by chance they take a short ramble to their Country House, the main of their business there is more to inquire into their Neighbours concerns then their own; that they may know how other Mens Fruit-trees are blasted, the number of Cattel they have lost, and what a scanty Harvest they are like to have, and how well their Cyder keeps; with which impertinent remarks having fill'd their giddy brains, the worm wags, and away they must to the Town again. Now a true-bred Rustick, if he by chance meet with any News from the City, he presently turns his head another way, and in his blunt language thus reflects upon the impertinence of it;
<q>
                     <l>One can't at quiet eat; nor plough ones lond;</l>
                     <l>Zo much us country-voke they bear in hond,</l>
                     <l>With Tales; which idle Rascals blow about,</l>
                     <l>How Kings (and well, what then?) vall in and out.</l>
                  </q> But the busy Cit hates the Country, as a dull, unfashionable thing, and void of mischief; and therefore keeps himself to the Town, that he may be among the Crowds that throng the Courts, Exchange and Wharfs, and pick up all the idle stories that are dropt in the <hi>Coffee-house.</hi> Here he goes about pumping, <hi>What news d'ye hear?</hi> Were
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:46331:260"/> not you upon the Exchange to day Sir? <hi>The City's in a very ticklish posture, what d'ye think on't? in two or three hours time we may be all together by the ears.</hi> If he's riding Post, he will light of his Horse, and ev'n hug, and kiss a fellow that has a story to tell him; and stay never so long till he hears it out; but if any one upon demand, shall answer <hi>No News!</hi> He replies, as in a passion, <hi>What</hi> (says he) <hi>have you been neither at the Exchange or Coffee-house to day? Have you not been towards the Court lately? Have you not heard any thing from those Gentlemen that newly came out of</hi> France? It was (methinks) a good piece of Policy among the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians,</hi> that if any Person coming from abroad, should but once ask concerning News, he was presently fin'd for his Curiosity, for as Cooks, and Fish-mongers wish for plenty in the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities they trade with: So are inquisite People that deal much in News, ever longing for innovations, alterations, variety of action, or any thing that is mischievous, and unlucky; that they may find store of Game for their restless ill-nature to hunt and prey upon. <hi>Charondas</hi> also did well in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting by a Law, that none should be brought upon the Stage to be expos'd, unless it were for Adultery, or this malignant sort of Curiosity: And indeed there is a near affinity between these two Vices, for Adultery is nothing else but the Curiosity of discovering another Mans secret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and the itch of knowing what is hidden; and Curiosity is (as it were) a rape and violence committed upon other Peoples privacies.</p>
               <p>And now as the accumulation of notions in the head usually begets multiplicity of Words; for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ch reason, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> thought fit to check the too early loquacity of his Scholars, by imposing on
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:46331:261"/> them five years silence from their first admission: So the same Curiosity that is thus inquisitive to know, is no less intemperate in talking too, and must needs be as ill-spoken, as 'tis ill-natured. And hence it is that Curiosity does not only become a restraint to the vices, and follies of others, but is a disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also to it self; for all Mankind is exceeding shy of inquisitive Persons, no serious business is consulted of, where they are; and if they chance to surprize Men in negotiation of any Affair, 'tis presently laid aside as carefully, as the House-wife locks up her Fish from the Cat, nor (if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid it) is any thing of moment said, or done in their company; but whatever is freely permitted to any other People to see, hear, or talk of, is kept as a great secret from Persons of this busy, impertinent Disposition; and there is no Man but would commit his Letters, Papers and Writings to the care of a Servant, or a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, rather then to an Acquaintance, or Relation of this busy and blabbing humour.</p>
               <p>By the great Command which <hi>Bellerophon</hi> had over his Curiosity, he resisted the sollicitations of a lustful Woman; and (though it were to the hazard of his life,) abstain'd from opening the Letters, wherein he was design'd to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of his own destruction. For Curiosity and Adultery, (as was intimated before) are both Vices of Incontinence; only they are aggravated by a peculiar degree of madness, and folly, beyond what is found in most Vices of this nature. And can there any thing be more sottish, then for a Man to pass by the doors of so many common Prostitutes that are ready to seize him in the Streets; and to beleaguer a Nunnery, or attempt breach upon the Lodgings of some coy and recluse
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:46331:261"/> Female, that is far more costly, and perhaps far less comely too, then a Hackney, Triobolar Strumpet. But such is plainly the Phrensy of curious Persons, who despising all those things that are of easy access, and unenvied injoyment, such as are the divertisements of the Theatre, conversation of the Ingenious, and the discourses of the Learned: must be breaking open other Mens Letters, listening at their Neighbours doors, peeping in at their Windows, or whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Servants; a practice, which (as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) is commonly dangerous, but ever extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly base, and ignominious.</p>
               <p>Now to disswade inquisitive persons (as much as possible) from this sneaking, and most dispica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humor, it would contribute much, if they would but recollect, and review all their past observations; for as <hi>Simonides</hi> using at certain times to open two Chests he kept by him, found that wherein he put rewards, ever full; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed for thanks, always empty: So if inquisitive People did but now and then look into their Bag of News, they would certainly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd of that vain and foolish Curiosity, which with so much hazard and trouble to themselves, had been gathering together such a confus'd heap of worthless, and loathsom trash. If a Man in reading over the Writings of the Antients, should rake together all the dross he could meet with; and Collect into one Volum all the unfinish'd scraps of Verse in <hi>Homer,</hi> the incongruous expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Tragedians, or those obscenities of smutty <hi>Archilochus,</hi> for which he was scorn'd, and pointed at, Would not such a filthy Scavinger of Books well deserve that curse of the Tragedian.</p>

               <p>Now since it is from the use and custom of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in the Affairs of other Men, that this perverse practice grows up into such vitious habit: therefore the best expedient for the remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that beginning (as it were) at a distance, and with such things as do less excite the itch of of our Curiosity; we gradually bring our selves to an utter desuetude of inquiring into, or being concerned at any of those things that do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto us. Therefore let Men first make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of themselves, in smaller, and less considerable matters; as for the purpose, why should it be thought such a severe piece of self-denyal, for any man, as he passes by, to forbear reading the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions that are upon a Monument, or Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, or the Letters that are drawn on Walls and Sign-posts? If it were but considered that there's nothing more, either for delight or benefit, to be learn'd thereby, but that certain People had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to preserve the Memory of their Friends and Relations, by engraving their Names on Brass or Marble; or that some impudent Quack, or rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tradesman wants Money, and knows no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to draw Men to their Shop or Lodgings, but by decoying Billets, and the invitation of a Show-board. The taking notice of which, and such like things, although it may seem for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent harmless; yet there is really a secret mischief wrought by it; while men suffering their minds to rove so inconsiderately at every thing they see, are inur'd to a foolish Curiosity in busying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:46331:263"/> about things impertinent. For as skilful Huntsmen do not permit their Beagles to <hi>fling or change;</hi> but lead them forth in <hi>couples,</hi> that their Noses may be kept sharp for their proper Game,
<q>
                     <l>Be it the Stag lodg'd in the woody shade,</l>
                     <l>Or Fox in borrow'd den by Badger made.</l>
                  </q> So ought Persons of an inquisitive temper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the wanton excursions of their Curiosity, and confine it to observations of Prudence and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. Thus the Lyon and Eagle, which walk with their Claws sheath'd, to keep them always pointed for their Prey; are an example of that discretion, which Curious Persons should imitate; by carefully preserving those noble faculties of Wit and Undestanding, which were made for useful, and excellent enquiries, from being dull'd, and debauch'd with low, and sottish speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The second remedy of this Curiosity is, that we accustom our selves in passing by, not to peep in at other Mens Doors or Windows; for in this case the Hand and Eye are much alike guilty; and <hi>Xenocrates</hi> said, <hi>One may as well go, as look into another Mans House;</hi> because the Eye may reach what the hand cannot; and wander, where the foot does not come. And besides, that 'tis neither gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iel, nor civil thus to gaze about; a well-bred Person will commonly discover very little that is either meet or delightful to look on: But foul Dishes perhaps lying about the Floor, or Wenches in lazy, or immodest postures, and nothing that is decent, or in good order, but as one said upon this occasion.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:46331:263"/>
                  <l>For ought here's worth your seeing, Friend, you may</l>
                  <l>Ev'n turn your prying look another way.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And yet laying aside this consideration of uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sights, this very staring and glancing of the Eyes to and fro, implies such a levity of mind, and so great a defect in good manners, as must needs render the practice in it self very clownish and contemptible. When <hi>Diogenes</hi> observ'd <hi>Dioxippus</hi> a Victor in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Exercises, to wreath his Neck as he sate in his Chariot, that he might take the better view of a fair Damsel that came to see the Sports; <hi>Look</hi> (says he) <hi>what a worthy Gamester goes there, that even a Woman can turn him which ways she lists:</hi> But these busy-brain'd People do so twist and turn themselves to every frivolous Show, as if they had acquir'd a verticity in their heads, by their custom of gazing at all things round about them. Now (methink) 'tis by no means seemly, that the sense, (which ought to behave it self as a Hand-maid to the Soul, in doing its Errands faithfully, returning speedily, and keeping at home with submissive, and reserved Modesty;) should be suffer'd like a wanton, and ungovernable Servant, to be gadding abroad from her Mistress, and straying about at her pleasure. But this happens according to that of <hi>Sophocles,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>As when untam'd, and hard-mouth'd Colts disdain</l>
                     <l>Both lash and spur, nor will abide the rein:</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:46331:264"/> For so the senses not exercis'd, and well manag'd, will at every turn break loose into wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, and hurry reason along with them into the same extravagance.</p>
               <p>It is said of <hi>Democritus,</hi> that he voluntarily put out his Eyes by the reflection of a burning glass; that (as by the darkning of Windows, sometimes done for the same purpose;) he might not by the allurements of sense be called off from attending to his purely intellectual contemplations: which Story, although it be false, yet this at least is true; that those Men who are most addicted to profound speculations, do least of all others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the impressions of sense. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent that interruption, and disturbance, which either noise, or impertinent visits might be to their Philosophical Enquiries, they plac'd their Studies at some distance from Cities, and chose the night (thence called <hi>Euphrone</hi>) as the fittest season for Meditation.</p>
               <p>Farther, to forbear mixing with a crowd of Fellows that are quarrelling in the Market place; or to sit still, while the mad Rabble are rioting in the Streets, or at least to get out of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; will not be very difficult to any Man that considers how little there is to be gained by intermedling with busie and unquiet people; and how great the certain advantage is of bridling our Curiosity, and bringing it under subjection to the commands of reason. And thus, when by this more easy Discipline, a Man hath acquir'd some power over himself; exercises of greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are to be attempted: as for instance, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Theatre upon the tempting Fame of some new and much applauded Play; to resist the importunity of a Friend that invites thee to
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:46331:264"/> a Ball, an entertainment at the Tavern, or a Consort of Musick; and not to be transported, if thou chance at a distance to hear the din at a Bull-baiting, or the noise of the Bear-Garden. For as <hi>Socrates</hi> advises well, that Men should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from tasting those meats and drinks, which by their exquisite pleasantness, tempt the palate to exceed the sober measures of thirst and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: so are all those oblectations of the Ear and Eye to be avoided, which are apt to intice Men into impertinence, or extravagance. When <hi>Aras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> had commended the fair <hi>Pantheae</hi> to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as a beauty worth his admiration; he reply'd, for that very reason I will not see her, lest if by thy persuasion I should see her but once, she her self might persuade me to see her often, and spend more time with her, then would be for the advantage of my own Affairs. So <hi>Alexander</hi> upon like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, would not trust his Eyes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the beautiful Queen of <hi>Persia;</hi> but kept himself out of the reach of her Charms, and treated only with her aged Mother. But we alas, (that no opportunity may be lost of doing our selves all the mischief we can by our Curiosity;) cannot forbear prying into Sedans and Coaches, nor gazing at the Windows, nor peeping under the Belconies, where Women are; nay, must be staring about from the House top to spy out all occasions of our Ruine: and are all the while so sottishly inconsiderate, as to apprehend no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from giving such a boundless License to our wandring Eyes. Now as in point of Justice and Honesty, it conduces much to prevent our defrauding, and over-reaching of other Men, if we now and then, and in smaller matters vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily abate somewhat of our strict dues; and
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:46331:265"/> as 'tis a means to keep Men Chast and Continent towards all other Women, if they sometimes forbear the lawful enjoyment of their own Wives: so will these excesses of Curiosity be cur'd by the same restraints, if instead of enquiring into what concerns other Men, we can prevail with our selves so far, as not to hear, or see all that is done in our own Houses; nor to listen to every thing that may be told us concerning our selves, or our private Affairs. <hi>Oedipus</hi> by his Curiosity fell into great mischief, for being of a Parentage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unknown, and now at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he was a Stranger; he went about asking Questions concerning himself, and lighting on <hi>Laius,</hi> he slew him, and then by the Marriage of the Queen, who was his own Mother, he obtained the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Not contented with the thoughts of being thus happy, he must needs once more (against all the persuasions of his Wife) being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring concerning himself; when meeting with an old Man that was privy to the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, he pressed him earnestly to reveal the secret: and beginning now to suspect the worst, the old Man cried out
<q>Alas! So sad a tale to tell, I dread;</q> But he burning with impatience of knowing all, replies,
<q>And I to hear't, but yet it must be said;</q> Thus odly mixt with pain and pleasure is this restless itch of Curiosity, that like a healing wound, it will hazard the loss of blood, rather then want the seeming ease of being rubb'd and and scratch'd. But such as either by good Nature,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:46331:265"/> or good Discipline are free from this Disease, and have experienc'd the unvaluable felicity of a calm and undisturbed Spirit, will rather rejoyce in being ignorant, then desire to be informed of the Wickedness, and the Miseries that are in the World, and can sit down well satisfied in this Opinion,
<q>
                     <l>What Vice and Mischiefs Mankind overflow,</l>
                     <l>'Tis Wisdom to forget, or not to know.</l>
                  </q> Wherefore as a farther help to check the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of our Curiosity, it will contribute much to practise such Acts of Abstinence as these; If a Letter be brought thee, lay it aside for some time before thou read it, and not (as many do) eagerly fall upon the Seal with Tooth and Nail, as soon as ever it comes to thy hands, as if 'twere scarce possible to open it with sufficient speed; when a Messenger returns, do not hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rise up and run towards him, as if thou couldst not hear what he had to say, time enough; and if any one makes an offer to tell thee something that is new, say, thou hadst rather it were good and useful.</p>
               <p>When at a public dissertation I sometime made at <hi>Rome, Rusticus</hi> (who afterwards perished by the meer Envy of <hi>Domitian</hi>) was one of my Auditors; a Message comes suddenly in with an express from <hi>Caesar:</hi> Upon which, when I offered to be silent, till he had perus'd the Paper, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd me to proceed, nor would so much as look into it, till the discourse was ended, and the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dismiss'd; all that were present much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the gravity of the Man. In great Persons, whose power encourages them to greater licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46331:266"/> this vitious Curiosity is hardly curable; for when it is arriv'd in them to the consistence of an inveterate habit, they will never undergo those previous restraints upon their outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are necessary to destroy the evil habit within them: For such as are thus injur'd, will be breaking up other Mens Letters, intruding upon the privacies of their Friends, making bold enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the unfathomable mysteries of Religion, profaning Sacred Places, and Holy Offices, by their coming where, and doing what they ought not, and in a word, prying into the most secret Acts and discourses of Princes; all, or any of which odious practices, it will be hard for any one after long custom to forbear, but especially for great Persons: And inded Princes themselves, who are concerned to have as particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things as they can, and to whom 'tis in some sort necessary for the ends of Government to maintain Spies, and Intelligencers about them: yet they are usually hated for nothing more, then their retaining this lewd sort of People in quality of <hi>Eves-droppers</hi> of State, and public Informers. The first that employ'd this kind of Officers, was <hi>Darius</hi> in his younger years, when he could not confide in himself, nor durst trust any one else; and the <hi>Sycilian</hi> Tyrants afterwards planted them in <hi>Syracuse,</hi> but upon a revolution that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened there; the People first fell upon these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and destroyed them without mercy. Of near affinity with these, are <hi>Calumniators,</hi> which from a particular occasion imported in the word, were called <hi>Sycophants,</hi> or <hi>Figblabbers;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon the prohibited exportation of that Fruit, they became Informers against those that brake this order. Much the like sort of people
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:46331:266"/> were those at <hi>Athens,</hi> where a dearth of Grain happening, and the Corn-sellers being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring out their Stores for publick Sale; those that went about listening at the Mills, and prying into Granaries, that they might find matter of Information against Offenders, were thence called <hi>Aliterians,</hi> or if you please, <hi>Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clackers.</hi> Now the Profession of these Fellows, as vile and base as it may be accounted; yet the end thereof being only to discover deliberate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and such violations of good order, as were mischievous to Society, it is for that reason by far less odious then the ill-natur'd practice of those inquisitive, and busy Persons, who out of malicious wantonness expose Men to open shame for unavoidable ills, and involuntary lapses. Which consideration superadded to the rest that has been said, is enough to render this sort of malignant Curiosity extreamly execrable, and to be highly abhorr'd, and most carefully avoided by every Man; who would desire for meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations sake, not to be rank'd among that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Crew of Villains, which are look'd upon as the most detestable of all Mankind.</p>
